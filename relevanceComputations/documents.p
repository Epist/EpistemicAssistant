V Ashley Micklos Discourse repair and coordination and convention  \u201clanguage is used by, for, and with people\u201d \u201clanguage learning is inherently interactive\u201d   \u201cA main tenant [of conversation analysis]: if something occurs that deviates from what is expected, then some other action is occurring.\u201d  (She uses this in the context of Grice\u2019s Maxims)  Turn-Taking (sequence of structures) Question answer sequences Entrainment (oscillator model (Wilson & Wilson, 2005)  Establishing who says what when.  There are confirmation tokens such as \u201coh\u201d How does one know when to confirm?  Talmyian manner and path movements are being taught and propagated through an iterated generational communication game.  Her hypothesis is that gestural iconicity is lost as the gestures are propagated over generations.   Measured guessing accuracy, time to complete, guessing time, and gesture length.   Other-initiated repair:  (lack of comprehension Lack of comprehension Delayed guess time Facial gestures Furrowed brow, eye gaze, mouth Not seeing Averted gaze  Repetition Clarification Reformation   Repair and repetition decrease over the generations  Self-initiated repair Other cannot know that something was wrong unless the \u201cspeaker\u201d marks it in some way.   She is interested in repair as a sign of conventionalization. Some types of repairs are used in the annealing process into an established convention. (Other types of repairs are done due to mistakes of different kinds.)  Experiment 2: Directing and matching with cards  Nouns have indefinite article Verbs have gerund \u201c-ing\u201d ending  Within a round, items are grouped for similar semantics.  Same gesturing mechanism of communication.  She hypothesizes that they learn marking strategies (see photo of slide) You mentioned that there was a particular gesture that didn\u2019t stick because it could only be used in the one instance. Do you see this type of example as illustrative of an implicit pressure towards general applicability or generalization   There should be pressure for independence (probabilistic) or modularity in addition to a pressure for general applicability.  The juxtaposition of alternatives that are related but of different types such as \u201chammering\u201d and \u201cnail\u201d yields a pressure to develop a convention to distinguish between the types such as nouns and verbs in this example.  Is the semantic similarity within chains or just within generations? If within chains, do you think that this development of noun-verb distinguishing conventions would still develop? I think that the pressure here is due to a within-trial pressure and that the cross-trial contextual differences should be relatively independent of this effect.

V Bertrand Schneider talk  Multimodal  synchronization can be a proxy for coordination.  He has work on language synchronization that he didn\u2019t show.  He has a cool system to capture joint visual attention via eye tracking and computer vision.  Joint visual attention is correlated with task performance, quality of collaboration, and learning gains. Very cool.  He finds that there is one person who is likely to be the driver of an interaction and another who is likely to be the passenger. (Among other things, the driver manages turn-taking) Why passenger? Shouldn\u2019t it be more like a director and a worker? What does the passenger even contribute?   Anaphoras facilitate communication. Anaphoras and explicit joint gaze facilitate communication. Computationally, why is it that anaphoras facilitate communication???  He does not appear interested in the deep mechanisms behind why these things facilitate coordination. These kinds of things are applicable to all sorts of social interactions. He wants to build a toolkit for all of these things.  He wanted to give realtime feedback on coordination and collaboration to people.  He wants to explore what kinds of feedback is most effective.  Diads are the simplest cases, but what about polyadic cases?

V Reqs info Math 180A introduction to probability COGS 118? At least four of the issues courses should be taken within the department (flexible) Issues courses taken outside of the department require approval of advisor plus Seana Must take five of the issues courses for a letter grade One methods course must be a statistics course (machine learning counts as a statistics course) \u201cEd Vul isn\u2019t good at teaching statistics\u201d \u2013Seana Math 189, or Math 289, or    Second year project: Original research Written proposal Written report suitable for publication 20 minute talk Also possible to do a first year project  Also give a talk at the end of the third year about what you plan to do your dissertation on Also possible to advance to candidacy in your third year 200 only needs to be done before you finish  Required to go to happy hour  Three published papers could be a Ph.D. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to write some tome\u201d \u2013Seana  First year: See Photos  Make sure that David is cool with me doing most of my work with other people i.e. Levy (Make sure that they have a similar research view)  Take interdisciplinrity seriously Read lots o stuffs  \u201cKirsh was practically a Buddhist monk or something\u201d \u2013Seana Lera Boroditsky \u201cIt is an incredible privilege to be a part of the academic lifestyle.\u201d \u2013Lera  Success compounds in academia. Success made early on results in large dividends later This is our time to invest and button down and focus Goal is to put as much gas in your tank now  \u201cT-shaped person\u201d  Depth in your focus and breadth in other disciplines  \u201cTalk to everyone about what you do\u201d  Initiative is what makes good graduate students Have the will to do something without waiting for someone to tell you to do it  Do something. Don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good  The best ideas come from being immersed in a project Have a few good hours every day where all distractions are off and you are just inside your research project.  Read and read and read Read ALL of the literature related to what you are working on Know more than anyone else on your topic  She likes to write-up a little summary when she reads  Organize all of your papers and summaries and notes Start this organization early (Maybe build my organization system in a more complete fashion)  Get and give good feedback  Sign up to TA courses that will help you in your research  Be helpful but not too helpful. Do not do everything in the department.  Help with job searches (it is a synergetic activity)  Make sure that you get known as an entity to the people in your area.  Some people shine more in larger settings, some more in more intimate settings  Your work should be a coherent body of research that has a clear forward trajectory Make sure there is a clear path as to what you are likely to do in the future  You want people to vouch for you Letters might be the most important thing  Have a record of being a good egg  Use time to think deeply about things  Set up a clear authorship policy early on 	Should be both a prediction and a reflection of the work  Keep snacks around for night thinking and writing \u201cThe night becomes timeless when no one is around.\u201d \u201cI can just be with the thoughts.\u201d \u2013Lera  \u201cIn American culture there is a morning-person hegemony. It is morally upright to be up early. I don\u2019t subscribe to that.\u201d -Lera  The structure of an introduction: What\u2019s the question? What is known? What is not known? How will I address what is not known? Why is it important? -Lera   Give an informal talk before writing (make some slides and present to your lab)   Ben Bergen  Little is known about the content or structure of messages We don\u2019t know shit about them  Except there are lots of similar patterns between hearing words associated with actions and preforming the actions. For language comprehension at least  Ben is showing that it also works for production   Hypothesis: Planning language about actions and articulating speech use shared motor resources Prediction: people should make more speech hours when talking about actions other than those performed by the mouth   Ziowen Tu Probability Tutorial  All models are wrong Some models are useful We always make modeling assumptions  Probability is for dealing with uncertainty   Always define what your input space is and what you output space is  Important to understand the event (the generating process). The math then falls into place.   Disjoint events cannot be independent because if A and B cannot occur together, then knowing that A occurs changes the probability that B occurred. (Knowing about A affects your knowledge of B.)  The joint probability is the probability of each combination of all variables The marginal probability is the probability of a variable ignoring another (or marginalizing over the other)    They can inject top-down detailed models into the nets to augment the low-level data. Questions for Professor Tu  Do you think there would be a way to derive representations of components that apply to featural components. Lets say you have a visual concept of bikes and a visual concept of cars and you have given the prompt \u201cBikes and cars have wheels.\u201d Would you be able to then compute a visual concept of wheels (or a set of conceptual hypotheses) based on just what it in common?  Maybe if you know other facts like \u201cwheels are round\u201d and you have a visuo-spatial concept of round, then you could have a better hypothesis.  What if you had an eye tracker and linguistic prompts and natural visual stimuli. Would you be able to recognize and build models of the features that correlate with the word? (or you could have the person name objects in their visual fields.)  Let\u2019s say that we have two visual concepts and a compositional concept that together yield a concept that we do not have a name for. How can we make sure that the resultant concept fits within a model of things that are possible in the world?    Multiple-instance learning is analogous to cross-situational learning   Doug Nitz  Pockets of inactivity in spiking are sufficient to completely destroy your awareness of the world. Even though the other times include spiking like normal. The greater rhythm of activity and inactivity is modulated by the Thalamus.   40 hz rhythm correlates with consciousness. Shared with Cats and monkeys as well!   Neural representations hold information about the recent past and projections of the near future. David Foster\u2019s work is related to this. CA1 Neurons hold this representation.  TALK TO DOUG NITZ ABOUT HOW THIS RELATES TO PHILOSOPHY OF MIND   Know what you know and know what you can\u2019t know.   Vicente\u2019s research is on different transforms and distances that might comprise psychological space.    It should be possible to create a Bayesian model of Sarah\u2019s speaker based processing data where object referent probabilities are determined by the set of examples that have been presented to the participants. Would this be an interesting result? It allows the modeling of referent predictions based on speaker information. This is informative potentially towards modeling how we can take more general information (rather than specific examples) and use it for principled Bayesian prediction.  Kirsh "By changing the represeantational system, we elevate some properties and suppress others." -Kirsh  Humans can think in different sensory modalities.    "How do I know what I think until I see what I say" - EM Forster   For Kirsh, references are mediators for meaning.    We model and we manipulate in order to probe. We do not know what we will see before we manipulate, but they allow us to think through the constraints and properties captured in the model.     Is gesture a form of marking?   Maybe we can study coordination with dance in addition to language?    "Expert memory is a different phenomenon than non-expert memory." -Kirsh Presumably this is because the experts have well-developed domain-specific schemas.   In full practice, all variables are interacting. In marking, the components might be more separated.    Klemmer \u201cWicked problems\u201d \u2013 both figuring out what the problem is and what the solutions are simultaneously.   Design -> Implementation -> Prototype -> Design ->  Can be used for theories amongst many things  Get feedback earlier than you think you should. Pilot early, share plans with research group early, etc.  Possible to prototype research papers. (Tell them I\u2019m interested in feedback on the line of argumentations, not the writing.)  Tell people what you want feedback about.  When writing research papers, instead of \u201cthis is what I want to tell you\u201d try \u201cthis is what I want the reader to know by the end.\u201d   Prototyping: rapidly creating some implementation of a design that you can get feedback on. Prototypes embody a design hypothesis. You have a point of view, and the way that you articulate that point of view is through the prototype.  What is the representation appropriate to use to evaluate?  The way that you make stuff faster is by deciding that there are these things that I care about, and these other things that I don\u2019t. This is essential for prototyping. It efficiently allows you to change the representation and get a new understanding of the design.  Explicit phases are important for keeping yourself sane. (Avoids \u201canalysis paralysis\u201d) They keep you from thinking about all parts at once. Brainstorm all problems -> pick one -> brainstorm all solutions -> choose one ->   The rights of a prototype: Should not be required to be complete Should be easy to change Gets to retire  With most research projects, you can come up with some kind of prototype in an afternoon, which will give you useful feedback.  \u201cThe best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas\u201d  Creative ideas come from the people who have the necessary knowledge to do the creative thing.  Its useful to know a slightly different set of stuff than everyone else.  If you pick a slightly different race than everyone else, and it turns out to be a good one, then you\u2019re in good shape. (Much easier than winning the race that everyone else is in.)   Start projects with high entropy (lots of exploration), then narrow focus. This helps avoid getting stuck on a poor path.  If the cost of change is low, then get your product out earlier, if high, do lots of testing first.  He has office hours on Thursdays from 5-6. Drop by and ask him anything.  It\u2019s ok to try any prototype.  Tell people when they are missing something. Share your work before you are ready

V Simon Kirby He demonstrates how evolution of language helps to capture the natural human conceptual generalization structure.  There needs to be a pressure to be learnable and a pressure to be expressive. This is exactly analogous to my analysis of what is essential in a linguistic communication system.  He has a very similar task to the girl who gave a CRL talk.  Gestures become more conventional.  He claims: Languages adapt to pass more easily from learner to learner.

V Causality and Signaling   In order to benefit from a signal, we need to have some knowledge of what it is that the signal is signaling. This knowledge need not be of the absolute cause of the signal nor of the intention of the signal, but simply some information carried by the signal. We simply need to know something that the signal carries information about.  This is a very easy to meet criterion for a number of reasons, the primary reason being that we do not observe signals in isolation, but alongside things that the signals may carry information about. If we observe a correlation between the occurrence of something and the occurrence of the signal, then we may infer that this signal may carry information about this occurrence. Of course there is a rich body of theory associated with how these relations are learned and what constitutes a legitimate causal relation as opposed to a spurious correlation, so we will leave it largely to this body to cover the details. For now suffice it to say that a signal only has meaning if it carries information about something.   In this definition of a signal, there are natural signals and artificial signals\u2026   Go through a simple example of learning a signal about something in the world.   Explain that this generalizes to our entire epistemic experience. (prediction, correlation, modeling, signals, generalization, etc.)   But what about signals for things that we cannot observe? How do these work?   Argue that we have many of these and use them all the time, especially when communicating between humans.   Explain the epistemic structure of these signals.    Perhaps argue that all signaling and language related processes ought to be understood in terms of their underlying epistemic structure.   Talk about how this type of study sheds light on a number of phenomena such as:  Epistemic flexibility (that coordination does not require absolute understanding and alignment That there exist cases where the meaning of a signal or the associated alignment is easier to reason about than in others That there exist cases where this alignment is entirely undetectable and where the meaning of the signal is entirely on faith And discuss the implications of this for philosophy of mind   Also potentially bring in some other recent work that is effective due to its use of the epistemic structure principles motivated in this theory.

V WORKING IN THE NON-PROFIT SECTOR  If you want to get into Charity Work or working in the Non-Profit sector, it\u2019s important you get as much experience as possible.  Below are a variety of internships you can apply for, but it\u2019s crucial you also get volunteering experience for most of the jobs advertised.   INTERNSHIPS Most of the internships last from 6-8 weeks during the summer, and not only are good experience but could result in post-graduation work e.t.c.  Barnados - UK\u2019s leading children\u2019s charity for a 12 week placement. The scheme \u201cenables you to gain work experience and develop the valuable skills needed to kick start your career\u201d.  Macmillan Cancer Support \u2013 internships throughout the year, suitable for students and graduates  Cancer Research UK \u2013 Voluntary 12 week placements, intakes over the year\u2013 HQ in London, but interns can be based throughout the country.  Student Hub Ethical Internship Program -  Oxford\u2019s OUIIP internship program, detailed information on application process through link -   The following article is really useful on how you can use the Oxford Careers Service for finding volunteering schemes and internships e.t.c.              VOLUNTEERING  Volunteering \u2013 most non-profit jobs expect applicants to have a certain level of commitment in the field, and there\u2019s no better way to prove this then to gain volunteering experience.  Some of these are more exotic, but even getting involved with the local community will be a valuable thing to have on your CV.   A really great website for volunteering opportunities,  - more specifically for student opportunities;  Raleigh - Volunteering programs overseas for people from a wide range of background and nationalities, as a youth and sustainable development charity.  Worldwide Volunteering -  Travel Aid \u2013 Matches individuals with grassroots organizations in the developing world.  Allows a student the opportunity to live and develop within the communities they choose.   For information within Oxford, email the following link:  oxford@t-aid.org Global Brigades \u2013 student led health and development organisation. The Oxford branch is running three brigades in Ghana this year; Water, Microfinance and Medical. Info session this Thursday 17th January (http://www.facebook.com/events/203688646422313/)  Projects Abroad, useful for internship placements as well -http://www.projects-abroad.co.uk Local volunteering is just as valuable, for example;  A good selection of local opportunities can be found via the D of E website. And OxHub of course for volunteering opportunities whilst you\u2019re at uni: http://oxfordhub.org/xwiki/bin/view/Oxford+Hub/

V \u201cIn fact, Descartes argues that the only sure indication that another body possesses a human mind, that it is not a mere automaton, is its ability to use language in the normal way; and he argued that this ability cannot be detected in an animal or an automaton which, in other respects, shows signs of apparent intelligence exceeding those of a human, even though such an organism or machine might be as fully endowed as a human with the physical organs necessary to produce speech.\u201d  -Noam Chomsky in Language and Mind  This quote captures the fact that we reason about other minds through the kind of language that they produce. With our theory of conceptual alignment, we wish to prove why this is the case.   Such a test is similar to the \u201cTuring Test\u201d proposed in Computing Machinery and Intelligence except that Mr. Turing was more concerned about the fact that computers could conceivably act intelligently in the same way that humans do.

V 	 COLLECTIONS IN TEMPORARY  - TRINITY TERM 2013  	NOTICE TO UNDERGRADUATES     Formal written Collections will be held in the temporary hall to be erected outside the library at 9.30-12.30 and 2.30-5.30 on Friday 19 April and 9.30-12.30 on Saturday 20 April 2013. Your tutors will inform you of the subject(s) of your paper(s) and of the session(s), which you should attend. The Tuition Office will send a final timetable in the afternoon on Thursday 18 April.  Please observe the following arrangements:  1.	Come to the temporary hall 10-15 minutes before  or , as the case may be.  2.	Collect your question paper from the High Table area and writing paper from the tables.  3.	You may sit where you will at an appropriate distance from your neighbours.  4.	Ensure that your name and title of the paper is written clearly at the head of your script.   5.	When you have finished your paper, or when the invigilator tells you to stop, fasten your scripts together with the treasury tags provided and deposit them in the appropriate envelope on the High Table.  6.	Apart from the dress code, the same rules will apply as for University examinations, and these rules will be strictly enforced. In particular:  	(a)	You may not bring bags, books or notes (except that data books may be allowed in some subjects - your tutor will inform you if this is the case). Carry pens, calculators etc by hand or in a small pencil case. Please do not bring large bags as there is nowhere secure to leave them.  	(b)	No food or drink will be allowed in the temporary hall during the examination.  	(c)	You may not leave in the first 30 minutes of the examination, nor enter after the first 30 minutes.  	(d)	If you wish to leave briefly (e.g. to visit the toilet), raise your hand and ask an invigilator for permission. Only one person will be permitted to leave at a time.  	(e)	You may not talk, other than to ask the invigilator a question.  	Any breach of these rules will be reported to the Senior Tutor, who will take disciplinary action.  7.	Book prizes may be awarded for outstanding performance in Collections on the recommendation of subject tutors.      	Dr M.S. Griffith 	Senior Tutor  February 2013

V Coordination and communication is built fundamentally on inference. It is not the vague unquantifiable ostensive inference theorized by Sperber and Wilson, but a specific factorable relation of inference procedures that enables both highly flexible and highly regularized means of communication and coordination.  Communicative inference is causal  Communicative inference is modulated by signals  Signals can have few or many meanings and they can be clear or ambiguous  Signals can be compositional or they can be discrete  Signals are not a special class of actions, but actions used for signaling    Communication is causal inference. This causal inference proceeds like any other cognitive activity in that it involves interacting, both with cognitive capacities such as stored knowledge and representations as well as with the environment.  In this paper we illustrate how a common form of signaled communication involves all of these cognitive capacities. This is in stark contrast to signaling system models and those that require signals to have explicit meanings. It is also in contrast to Sperber and Wilson\u2019s ostensive inferential model, not in that it does not involve ostension and inference, but that we provide a much more structured framework for analyzing such communication, a formal model of the process, and a space for signal meanings to come into play themselves.  Basically, there are things in common with signaling models and with Relevance models, as is expected, but this new framework unifies all of this in a much more motivated manner.   In the case of high beam flashing, there is often no contextual implication as described by Sperber and Wilson, but an exploration process of causal inference.    But maybe we can use it as a clear example of how we can model the inference that goes on in such a scenario.   Inference about signal meaning involves a number of internal and external processes. These processes have different cost structures, and the disambiguation occurs in a principled manner, with the highest expected [relevant information]/[cost] ratio processes explored first to disambiguate the meaning. However, disambiguation does not proceed to absolute terms, but just enough to enable success at the task at hand.   People do causal inference to interperet the meaning of expressions and signals. This causal inference is most explicit and interactive when the meaning of an utterance is ambiguous given knowledge.   It is often the case that drivers need to communicate with each other. When driving at night, much of the communication takes the form of a single signal: flashing your high beams. The relatively singular nature of the signal comes from the limited amount of signals that can come from a car as well as from a variety of reasons why horns are not often used at night and the difficulty in seeing another driver\u2019s gestures at night.  Because of the limited variety of signal and the fact that the length of the high beam flash is not regularly modulated to signal different meanings, the meaning or communicative intention behind flashing one\u2019s high beams is highly ambiguous.  Though many theories treat ambiguity in language and communication, they often appeal to a nonspecific and austere realm known as context for their explanations. Even when this is not the case, we will see that they do not accurately predict the behavior going on when signaling with high beams. We use this as a motivating example for a new theoretical framework for communication. Though of course we remain true to many ideas and principles present in prior frameworks, we believe that we can account for the wide range of communicative phenomena in a much more principled manner. Additionally, this framework is articulated such that it lends itself well to formalization in a rational Bayesian structure. In order to justify all of these claims, we must continue onwards and immerse ourselves in the minds of those drivers who are signaled by a flash of another driver\u2019s high beams.   When at the receiving end of a flick of the \u201coptical horn\u201d or high beam lights, what do you do? It could mean any number of things:

V Inference about other minds is an extension of inference about the world. Coordination, while built upon inference about other minds, involves distinct principles from theory-of-mind type inferences. In coordination, one is not inferring the coordination partner\u2019s beliefs, but attempting to reach a goal that is dependent upon the actions of the other agent. In order to do this, one needs to align one\u2019s goals with the goals of the other agent such that the actions produced by the other agent help oneself to reach his own goals.  We can define coordination as   Coordination acts on coordination goals, which may or may not differ from the pragmatic goals of the agents. Coordination goals are the structures that guide actions of coordinating agents towards achieving pragmatic goals.

V Computational Mechanisms of Human Communication (and philosophical issues) Introduction	 Current theory of communication is a highly fragmented affair. We have models and theory for many aspects of communication. [Go through the phenomena modeled each with a sentence and a citation. Ex: Information theoretic models capture the information transfer inherent in a communication process (Shannon, Ramscar, etc.)] But no single theoretical framework can account for all of the phenomena, and there are some which are not satisfactorily captured by even a single framework. [Go through the theories and very briefly discuss the phenomena that they do not capture and where they do not generalize.] Sperber and Wilson have pointed out that we should not expect such a unifying theory of communication as communication involves a vast number of processes of many kinds that are not alike [get an actual quote]. Though this is certainly true, it claims only that we cannot expect a unifying theory at a certain level of abstraction. [Go into more detail about what we cannot expect.] On the other hand, if we take a step backwards, it is possible to notice some common features across all communication. Though constructing a theoretical framework will certainly not provide the same level of constraint and mechanistic prediction as a theory of language and of grammar, it enables us to gain a perspective on communication that captures the fundamental features at work. By taking this view, we can then understand more specific mechanisms of communication in a new and rather helpful way. The commonalities across the diverse communication mechanisms will become apparent, and we will be able to explain other previously unnoticed or unformalized aspects of communication with respect to this framework. This is the task that this paper sets out to do. [Need to motivate the need for a new theory. Explain some problems with current work.] Current theories are incomplete and fail to generalize They do not take into account conceptual alignment and the lowest level inferences about word meanings, especially in the abstract. They don\u2019t really account for phenomena such as discourse alignment They are too rigid to account for the full extent of cognitive processes that go on when using language. It is not just a means of message passing and information transfer. No one theory accounts for all the phenomena we observe Many of the more complex phenomena are not accounted for at all within a formal framework Current NLP systems understand utterances as utterances and relatively independently of what they call context. Context can be much better represented as a contingency and then the prediction can run off of utterance contingencies as a basis instead of on the utterance itself Language acquisition in current theories is COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT of language use Noisy channel models are very prevalent in natural language recognition, but they are not really correct  Information theoretic models Do not account for the origin of common ground, nor do they account for conceptual alignment Were developed for machine communication, which involves different constraints and processes. Coordination and convention based models Lewis Herb Clark Frank and Goodman These generally involve assumptions about common ground and about conceptual alignment Artificial grammars Insufficiently flexible. Even so, they only fully account for communication when combined with a LAD and a coordination theory such as Lewis\u2019 Basic predictive models of communication I.e. Andy Clark These tend to be insufficiently detailed and do not account for the functions of words and language. They are a promising start though. Simulation semantics This captures a lot of the nature of language understanding, given that the person knows and understands the language. However, they do not delve into the nature of communication Goal-directed planning and theory of mind Action understanding as inverse planning (Baker, Saxe, Tenenbaum) Adena Schachner\u2019s work This assumes that there are always goals that are being inferred and does not delve into the workings of language too much. Another good start though. Communication as invoking similarity Meltzoff \u201cLike Me\u201d Uri Hasson\u2019s work This introduces the important principle of similarity, but does not touch a theory of either language or communication. It serves more as neurological and experimental evidence that similarity is modulated by language and successful communication Flexible concepts and categories and inference Ad Hoc Cognition This brings up an essential realization that concepts are not fixed and modular and that communication involves heavily context-driven inference. However, as far as I can tell, there is no explicit proposal for a theory of communication or coordination Turing test like models Not so much a theory of communication, but a good set of example cases that tend to demonstrate inferences about the mental states of others  Cues and correction Work like that of Ashley Micklos Not sufficient because misunderstanding cues can only be generated when there is recognition of misunderstanding, which, in this theoretical framework, is inferred through misunderstanding cues, yielding a circular framework unless other processes are appealed to Words as handles on concepts This is a powerful associations paradigm, but does not propose specific mechanisms of association and does not account for conceptual alignment [First explain how these work and the extent of the phenomena they capture. Later demonstrate the shortcomings of each when applied to the general case of communication.] Most of these have a lot of explanatory power within their spheres of influence, but none is sufficiently general to capture the nature of communication. Each is a special case and there is much debate and fogginess at the boundaries and overlaps of the phenomena each tool has been used to analyze. In order to repair this, it will be useful to specify a more general framework for understanding communication. Not only will this framework help to resolve conflicts between existing systems, but it will also help shed light on other phenomena that are essential for communication, but of which there has been little explicit study. We will begin with coordination problems such as those that were analyzed by David Lewis, but we will approach them in a slightly different manner informed by the new tools and perspectives of our time including Bayesian inference and generalization theory. From this beginning we will expand the domain to include broader domains of language and eventually we will relate the present model to the other explanatory frameworks covered above. The initial theory will explore coordination in terms of contingencies between what is said and what is done in a similar manner to Lewis\u2019 Convention. This idea of contingencies will then be expanded to include relations between actions and states more generally and then to cover, not only how contingencies are used for coordination, but also how observations of similar contingencies can help establish conventional contingency relations. This joint framework for learning and inference as well as for communication will become the backbone of the theory, which will later be expanded to cover a broader and more complex set of linguistic and non-linguistic communication practices through the application of Bayesian probabilistic learning theory and generalization theory. In contrast to the eventual generality and power of the theory as fully articulated and formed, we begin, as Lewis did, with a simple exploration of coordination problems.  Coordination scenarios In this section I will go through a variety of scenarios that require coordination and use these scenarios to introduce some features of the coordination and communication theory. These features and principles will be covered only roughly in this section, but hopefully their immersion within a concrete scenario will help serve as conceptual scaffolding to help us to construct the more formal theory that will begin in the next section.  Coordination problems necessarily involve a sort-of inference about the goals and actions of others. But they do not require explicit reasoning about their accompanying beliefs and mental states. This is because all that is required is coordination of behavior. As this is a simple case of a more general communication process that may involve these explicit inferences, we begin here. It should be noted, however, that while the theory is being developed in these coordination scenarios, its real power comes out only in the more general case of communication. Though many features of coordination problems have been accounted for in a formal framework (Lewis 1969), there does not yet exist a framework that generalizes beyond this to account for all the phenomena and processes of communication that we find essential. [Discuss contingencies and coordination. Define contingencies.] [Discriminate production contingencies and inference contingencies. These are naturally symmetric.] Contingencies involve observing the structure of the changes in observations that are introduced by performing an action. These are inferential contingencies. What they help to infer are the contingencies at work in the other agent. I.e. the relations between receiving a certain signal in a certain environmental state and their resultant behavior. Of course this is complicated dramatically by the unobservable internal state of the other agent. Though the contingency is also unobservable, it can be inferred through probing, but if it depends on other unobservable properties, then this inference cannot be complete. How we fill in the gaps in this incompletely determined inductive process will be covered in the section on generalization. For now we focus on the much simpler case where the action of the other person depends solely on the state of the world that is jointly observable. We will demonstrate the mechanism for inference of these simplified contingencies and how this enables coordination and communication.  Chess game Introductory for the notation and for the three types of contingency interpretations Simple scenario where moves made by the opponent enable inferences about the opponent\u2019s understanding of the rules The three types are: Expected responses Those that are consistent with the current predictive model of the opponent Unexpected, but post-hoc explainable responses This means that they did not fit into the prior model of the opponent\u2019s behavior or mental states, but that it was possible to find an alternative model to account for them. It is a kind of hypothesis switching These types of inferences show a nice similarity to predictive models of communication. However, we can probably show that the prediction is not necessary, only that an intuitive theory about the other person\u2019s mental state or intended message is necessary Unreconcillable responses Those for which a consistent predictive model of the opponent\u2019s behavior cannot be found These often result in the player giving a signal of misunderstanding or of interacting with the opponent in order to reconcile their misalignment Not particularly good evidence for why contingencies are the quantity of interest This example mostly deals with the types of inferences about the opponent, not the dependency of these inferences on the state of the world Serving at Chipotle Demonstrates contingencies based on the station. i.e. given \u201cblack or pinto beans?\u201d the reasonable responses of the customer are different from given \u201cchicken, steak, or veggie?\u201d and this cleanly defined set of responses yields a simple example of contingency-based reasoning about interlocutor understanding. Still retains a relatively simple space and representation Doctor\u2019s office visit Demonstrates how we can use contingencies alongside similarity assumptions to explicitly infer others\u2019 mental states Different types of pains and sensations can be inferred through probing the other person and assuming a parallel between their mental state-response contingencies and your own This serves as a special case to the more general similarity/generalization topic and a simple introduction This process is done through the neurodynamic processes that are currently lumped under the mirror neuron moniker Turing test Give linguistic examples of all the phenomena explored so far This should help show how all of these processes have interesting analogs in discourse The three types of contingency interpretations can be demonstrated in a variety of discourse examples Expected responses are simple to show Unexpected but reconcilable responses are the types of situations where a response was unexpected, but where it leads to a new interpretation of the communicator\u2019s intended message or mental state Unreconcillable responses are those that simply do not make sense and for which the listener cannot find an interpretation that would enable them to make sense Contingency processes can be demonstrated simply by discourse situations where certain phrases would make sense only given an earlier state or piece of common ground This can also be used to back-infer a state that was not clearly known if the utterance would only make sense in a given state or with a given piece of common ground. This inference might be understood in a Bayesian Viterbi type way This helps introduce communication and coordination as a certain type of inference procedure  It will set the stage for the formalization and for the eventual addition of generalization theory  A formal approach to signaling and coordination [For preliminary notes, see the document entitled \u201coptimal communication\u201d]  Before we develop a formal approach, let us explore the nature of coordination more precisely. [Pylyshyn style black box except analyzed with the tools of computational learning theory.]  Contingencies in an active manner are similar to active sensing. We sense the result of the changes we introduce to the world or to another mind. In vision, these changes are introduced to the perceived world by changing our relationship to the world, in echolocation, they are produced by sending a probe of sorts into the world, and in language there is a similar pattern.  Introduce the causal graph here to illustrate the information flow in the contingency process.  This generalized causal model captures the effect of your action on the internal state and the effect of the external state and the partner\u2019s internal state on the partner\u2019s action. In this way it illustrates the causal pathways involved for active contingency inference, passive contingency inference, and inference of continued processes over time for a turn-taking discourse. Establishing conventions and common ground   Generalization and inference  For dealing with scenarios, states, and actions, not before seen For dealing with compositionality For learning the roles of components in a compositional system For inferring the role of the unobservable internal state in the contingencies This requires both similarity and generalization Similarity works through generalization. We notice similarities between ourselves and the other and we therefore can use these similarities to infer that there exist other unconformable similarities in the relationship between internal state and external state-action contingencies. Though these similarities are unconformable, we can gain information about them through interdependency-type contingency analyses. Of course, there is always the possibility of exchangeability with respect to the internal state. A paradigm case of this is color phenomena.   Show that inference is dependent on hypotheses and priors  Demonstrate that hypotheses priors are instantiations of generalization bias Explore where this generalization bias comes from and what determines the correct generalization bias.   Just as sensorimotor contingencies serve as predictive mechanisms and are learned in a general way, so are signal-response contingencies in intersubjective communication.   We can take the black box thought experiment from the earlier section and add generalization to it and therefore show that there must be similar generalization biases.   It is important to EMPHASIZE in this work that we are not making any assumptions at all about the nature of the problem in the model. This enables us to use this as a theory about how humans can model these interactions without leaning on things that we already know about the structure of these processes. If we build our knowledge of these processes into our model of how we model these processes, then we are not actually capturing how we come to this knowledge in the first place. Though a highly abstract theoretical model such as this will not make specific predictions as much as provide a framework for the theory, it is highly principled in that it acts more as a philosophical derivation than an engineering-style model, the later of which is increasingly prevalent in the cognitive science field. In essence, we have made a decision to favor theoretical purity over modeling detail in the hope that we can provide a principled approach to the study of human communication.   Deficiencies and biases, when shared and in common ground, become tools and perhaps the essential basis for communication.  Experimental Work Try to elucidate the degree to which we make inferences about others\u2019 understandings of our utterances and about conceptual alignment Need to demonstrate that human communication is robust to conceptual misalignment Catalogue on-the-fly inferences about other peoples\u2019 understandings and interpretations and use these examples to help motivate a theory of communication as an inferential coordination process

V Dan Lassiter Talk Cogs 200  His notion of vagueness vs. sharpness of conceptual extension corresponds nicely in a way to the analytic-synthetic distinction.  His lexical semantic interperetation of scalar adjectives claims that adjectives \u201ccompare an object\u2019s property along some threshold.\u201d   Your formulation of the sorietes paradox actually could equally act as a reductio ad absurdum for the threshold lexical semantic model that you propose. To me, a satisfactory solution seems to be to propose a degree semantics for scalar adjectives.  What is the motivation for a semantics with a strict threshold value on the extension of scalar adjectives?   Grice claims a logical skeleton underlying language and that the interesting, vague, and context dependent properties emerge from the pragmatics.  Bayesian action understanding: baker saxe and tenenbaum 2009  \u201cThe literal listener is like the listener that Richard Nixon thought we were. It is the kind of listener that, when he says \u201cI am not a crook,\u201d the listener goes, \u201coh, he\u2019s not a crook\u201d and incorporates that into his knowledge.\u201d -Dan Lassiter  Some philosophers apparently say that communication wouldn\u2019t be possible except with a background of assumed cooperativity.  Alternatives for his model are \u201ctall\u201d \u201cshort\u201d or not saying anything.  Why should people be forced to make a judgment over these alternatives?  Using recursive conditional probability conditionals seems to handle the paradox in a compelling manner. But this paradox only arises because of the strict threshold that is built into the proposed semantics.   Alternative semantics without a threshold explicitly or implicitly What if the meanings of adjectives such as tall comes from experience with the comparison version \u201ctaller\u201d in the following way. Within a context, we have experience with X is taller than Y and the approximate heights of X and Y for lots of Xs and Ys Then for a new X if it is asked if he is tall, the percentage of people in the context that he would be taller than would be estimated and therefore tallness would have a degree semantics dependent on distribution of comparisons This can be applied to new contexts through our understandings of the height distributions within the contexts.  Of a 4-foot man, \u201cboy he\u2019s tall.\u201d This is not true with respect to the distribution. However, there is uncertainty for the listener about the distribution that is being considered by the speaker and whether it is the same one as the one the listener is considering.  Apparently this ends up needing the same considerations as a formal semantics such as a threshold.  A good question is how people learn these in development and whether it is comparison to these proposals for semantics.   Apparently children confuse things like hot and cold and tall and short. See: Kristen Siret Alexis Wellwood And maybe Dave Barner and Jesse Snedeker.

V More natural forms of turn-taking Human speakers are much more nuanced than dialogue systems  Clarification requests Continuation prompts Colaboration of utterances  Paetzel, Racca & Devault 2014 Mauvinakurike & Devault 2015 Echo confirmations Reconfigurations  People can predict the end of speaker turns, etc.  The natural language generation component appears not to have access directly to the text that came out of the automated speech recognition component. To me this seems to dramatically limit its capability. For example, discourse alignment effects such as implicitly agreeing on terminology for concepts cannot be captured.   Prediction ability should be measured by the entropy of the closure given the first part of the utterance and the context.  Classification of shallow features such as bigrams and skim grams into a space of 137 possible meanings for this domain. [MEANING IS MADE EXPLICIT AND IS NOT LEARNED!]  When do I understand enough that I can start acting on my prediction?  Moment of maximal understanding. Want to predict this.   Sometimes it repeats the last word that was said.  Is the question of whether it is a good idea to complete the statement taken into account?  Incremental understanding in the RDG game (the reference game).   Focused on quantifying the value of incremental processing to the system.  In his COREF model, an utterance is viewed as a plan to change the utterance in a specific way.   Fixed set of output utterances in most NLG systems. Ideally we would have better ones.  \u201cPart of what we\u2019re doing when building systems is trying to elucidate the problems we solve in conversation\u201d Rough quote  The user\u2019s speech was less disfluent when the system was nodding. This illustrates the importance of confirmation and understanding signals. By taking away the concern that they are not being understood, they become more fluent!!! Looks of puzzlement on the interlocutor cause you as a producer to become more disfluent in that you don\u2019t think that they are understanding what you are saying.

V For David Lewis, an action is a choice of a contingency plan. The plans come as whole units and so far do not appear to be conceived as divisible.  	\u201cIt should not disturb us that this is a problem of coordinating contingency plans, not\u2014as in the previous coordination problems\u2014of coordinating actions themselves. We are treating   How do people come to have the same contingency plans?  The problems with this come in the lack of generalization as well as the nature of the discrete actions, messages, meanings, and contingency plans. I propose a more general framework that takes these into account.  Want to know: Does David Lewis deal with the generalization problem that occurs when performing communications that have not previously been encountered? Does David Lewis deal with how members of a language community come to agree upon \u201ccontingency plans\u201d?

V Dear Professor Halbach, Our conversation on the way out was very helpful in my understanding of problems such as the one at hand with regards to whether knowledge is closed under implication. The issue I was having was that I did not recognize that the goal of philosophy is to thresh-out our intuitions of things such as knowledge. I am instead used to questioning the consistency of these intuitions with respect to definitions.  By this account it is clear that, because we cannot know if we are brains in a vat, but because we may know there is a chair, and because these contradict each other through implication, that our intuition of knowledge is therefore not closed under implication. Furthermore, if we continue to analyze the situations where we can and cannot claim to have knowledge, it arises that our concept of knowledge is context dependent.  I hope this convinces you that I now have an understanding of the problem and of the context in which we are working in this course.  Very best,  Larry

V Dear Tim, I regret to have to drop my tutorial and am all too aware that it is inconvenient for my tutor to have to change his schedule at such late notice.  I have already sent him an apology email, and I believe that my withdrawal now instead of later, after attempting the course material, will be better for both myself and for Mr. Horsewood. At the time of my application, I had a very strong interest in the subject of computational econometrics and had background in what I interpreted to be relevant to the subject matter. As my tutor has had a significantly different interpretation of my proposed course than I originally intended, this has caused me to lack the background required to do a good job in the class. Additionally, because my interests have changed significantly since my application (college is a time for rapid change for us as I am sure you understand, having been a first-hand witness to the amazing opportunities here in Oxford transform the Americans who arrive into citizens of the world over the course of a few short weeks), I could not anticipate that this tutorial would no longer be relevant to my education by the time I arrived here. Be that as it may, since I am here for such a short time I would really like to learn as much as I can from Oxford tutors and students while I am in this beautiful city. I apologize again for the inconvenience to all parties, and I hope that in the long run Mr. Horsewood may even prefer any other arrangements he can find for his time over teaching a student who has neither the acumen for nor interest in the subject of econometrics.  Very best,  Larry

V Discuss Martin\u2019s and Deutscher\u2019s theory of remembering! Need to find a review article whose style I like so that I can emulate it. This is because I am at a loss of how to style, form, and set the tone in such an essay as this.

V Sure, I, just as much as you, see without thinking, the difference between a table and a chair. Of course even more clearly distinct are a chair and a frog. If we branch across, what Gilbert Ryle referred to as categories, then we may easily see that this chair is distinct from rain, and even more so distinct from weather in general.  But have you ever asked why we perceive and so absolutely know such distinctions? Thus brings us into the understanding of categories, of concepts, of objects, of events, and of perception itself. The question of why weather is so different from a chair may be approached from many directions. There is first the philosopher, who argues that they are different because they are of different kinds, and he may go on to give a description of different kinds and how they interrelate and how to determine membership to one or to many of these kinds. There is also the scientist, who, whether a neuroscientist, a biologist, a physicist, or one who studies computation, will tend to have different frameworks for explaining these distinctions. They are physically separable, logically separable, and often not even comparable. Though most of us attack these distinctions  from the perspective of having an understanding of them built in, it is the scientist who wishes to build an intelligent machine who has the arduous task of building these distinctions from nothing. 	In artificial intelligence, concepts of any sort do not come for free. Simple recognition of a chair as separate from a table is a difficult exercise in analysis of raw perceptual data. Going further to interrelate concepts such as weather and chairs is much more difficult because it not only requires perceptual differentiation between chairs and tables, but also conceptual understanding of the cross-category interrelations between specific objects such as \u201cthat chair\u201d, general objects such as chairs, specific events of continuous type such as \u201cit rained yesterday\u201d, general events of continuous type such as rain, and classes of events such as weather. These are not exclusive or even hierarchical, and it poses an enormous challenge to engineers hoping to make a machine that can sort all of these out. But to us it is all easy. We were born with the ability to distinguish these things, and we easily learn labels for these and ways of manipulating and referring to all types of abstractions, objects, and occurrences. For most of us, it is incredibly difficult to understand why precisely a table is different from a chair and why both are different from the weather. They just are, and that is that. When we compare these pictures of machines who struggle with this and humans who find it so natural, we can get some interesting results. If we take the perspective of the machine, a chair is not so different from a table, unless significant labor is taken to program or to learn recognition of these differences. Humans, as we have mentioned above, find no difficult here and simply know that they are different things. But this juxtaposition allows us to see that they are not universally distinct, only distinct from the human perspective, for a machine will only recognize the different when programmed to do so by a human, and most animals will not even know the difference. If I threw a table into a shark\u2019s tank or a chair, it will probably not react so differently. This distinction is even more blurred when I throw a large chair vs. a small table, which happen to have similar shapes. The difference is simply not available from a shark\u2019s perspective, and only receives its true resolution from the perspective of a human. Now we may ask what other things are as they are only because we see them from the point of view of a human being? Language Other examples Talk about the physical structure of these things and how they are distinguished only by relevant pattern-recognition machinery. The pattern recognition machinery must be able to distinguish, and in the case of humans, this machinery tended to evolve in order to be useful at recognizing useful distinctions (although naturally there were other evolutionary riders and emergent traits that helped to foster further distinguishing abilities and eventually abilities such as language and science etc. (the later through cultural and linguistic evolution).  Now start talking about the debate between the physical and the phenomenological.

V Larry Muhlstein  Early Attempt at Articulating the Coordination and Communication Theory  Though coordination games are a powerful framework, they cannot account for many important phenomena in coordination and communication. Moreover, most models of communication do not bear on coordination as a general process, but presuppose coordination between agents that sets up the signaling systems, which then do the communicative work. Among many problems, this requires a divide between language acquisition and use, limits the flexibility of communicative processes, and fails to capture how we can infer things about others\u2019 mental states. In a coordination model, we want to account for how people\u2019s inferences about each others\u2019 mental states and the reasons behind their production of signals and actions relates to communication. We also wish to determine a minimum interaction required for coordination between individuals and to model the maximum amount of misalignment between thoughts and intentions that is tolerable when coordinating.  We treat both the Wittgenstinian view that coordination is a function on actions, as well as a more cognitively inspired view that coordination, though expressed in and viewed through the language of actions, is fundamentally a cognitive phenomenon that operates on \u201cmental states\u201d. In order to accommodate this later perspective, we use tools from generalization theory in the artificial intelligence realm and counterfactual analysis from the philosophical realm to articulate both what it means to successfully coordinate in a given instance and what it means to be in coordination in general. Just as in coordination game models, we do not put constraints on the form of speech acts, nor do we provide a theory of linguistic meaning. Instead, we treat speech acts simply as signals. However, in contrast to coordination games, our model does not claim that signals have an explicit meaning that has been previously coordinated on (wither directly or through coordinating on abstract structures such as grammars), but that signals guide inferences about the mental states of others and therefore the likelihoods of future actions that they might produce. We argue that this view can accommodate the highly regular communicative functions of languages well-established in a community and the ad-hoc coordination and communication we observe all the time. Additionally, we capture mental states without representational claims, but in what we will prove to be a fully general Bayesian framework. In order to argue for this non-representationality and generality, we make use of some proofs from generalization theory as well as demonstrate a few cases of how this form of representation maps cleanly onto others. Theoretically, our model is grounded in enactive cognition. We capture the epistemic structure of coordinated action by considering, not just the objective meaning of the signals, but how the signals get their meaning and how this signal meaning is coordinated upon online. The enactive framework stressed contingencies between action and perception, and we embrace this beyond the vision paradigm studied by O\u2019Reagan and No by extending it to contingencies about the behavior of the environment and other agents in response to actions. We also embrace the idea that coordination involves prediction and show that coordination, though possible in theory without predictive mechanisms, becomes much more powerful when predictive mechanism are involved. Hoffman\u2019s work on human-robot interaction has also shown through experimental contrast that incorporating predictive mechanisms into coordinating robots dramatically improves the naturalness and efficiency of coordination. We can analytically demonstrate that, when coordinated activity has a degree of regularity to it, predictive mechanisms that capture this regularity and use it to extrapolate likelihoods into the future will perform better than those that do not.  We also provide examples of coordination scenarios and use them to illustrate the principles of the theory/model at work.  The mechanisms of coordination can be captured by a factorization of the causal processes and relations between the agents and the environments into a particular form. Initially, we will constrain the processes we consider and factor them into a particular Markov process. We will then successively generalize various factors until we have a general model of coordination. Our factorization will be in terms of the observability structure of information required to complete a task. An alternative an additionally useful factorization that will be briefly analyzed is an aboutness factorization, where equivalencies are not in terms of the observability of information for a particular agent, but in terms of what the information represents. We find that both factorizations are useful for elucidating particular processes important for multi-agent coordination. [We should be able to prove that a conventional signaling system is fundamentally unable to capture the diversity of processes we observe in human communication. This could involve a parallel between an experiment and a proof. After this, we could introduce a formal model of communication.]  [Also note that we do not wish to derive formal semantics either current or new, but to derive a more accurate model of how language gets meaning in which we can investigate how specific meanings exist and could have arisen.] The initial model will apply to coordination scenarios where the agents take turns acting on the environment in order to progress towards a joint goal. We do not presently distinguish actions that are on the environment and designed to progress towards the joint goals (pragmatic actions) from those that are designed to enable improved singular or joint understanding or thinking about the situation (epistemic actions) from those that are designed simply to communicate something to the other agent (communicative actions), although there is reason to believe that there are interesting phenomena related to these differences (On Distinguishing Epistemic from Pragmatic Action or something like this). What we do distinguish, however, although we will not yet explore the details of this distinction, is the difference between ephemeral and persistent state properties. Ephemeral state properties are those introduced by the action that are part of the current decision between actions for either agent, but that do not persist in the state by themselves. A clear example of this is a speech act, which may change the state, either internal or external to the agent, but does not itself persist in the environment. Persistent state properties, on the other hand, are those that do continue to exist in the environment. We will consider later how different types of actions either introduce persistent state properties (such as the change in position of a block) or ephemeral state properties (such as the flashing of a light). In addition to the differences between actions and the state changes they induce, we also consider a distinction between the observability of different states. We consider the internal state of an agent to be those properties that affect the causality of the situation (most things) which are observable only to that agent and not to others. The prototypical example of this is the canonical mental state. Similarly, we consider the external state to be that which is observable to all agents. We simplify the situation by not considering properties that are observable to a subset of the agents involved, though there is no reason to believe that the introduction of these properties would significantly affect our conclusions about simple coordination scenarios. This will become a useful distinction because it separates the features of coordination by their epistemic properties and similarly their computational ones. We will find that these epistemic and computational distinction set us up to provide a very general theory of coordination while minimally sacrificing accuracy and that they will naturally enable us to account for known phenomena essential to coordination such as common ground in a principled manner. [Finish explanation of the basic modeling properties before generalization] Assume cooperativity Introduce the causal graph Explain how the causal graph gets extended iteratively into a turn-wise scenario Briefly explain inference mechanisms Briefly mention what will be extended later including internal states, generalization, explicit internal state (or belief) inference, and a less structured model of causality that progresses continuously without requiring explicit turn-taking  [Need to explain where common ground comes in. It is represented here in the internal states of both agents, but this factorization does not do justice to the aboutness property of common ground. Common ground, though it resides in each internal state individually, is actually an inference (for all agents) about the others\u2019 mental states and their inferences about yours, etc. which is derived from prior observations. It will be useful to depict this in a different type of graphical model and to dedicate a section to analyzing the instantiation of common ground as well as how common ground is learned and established. These learning processes are natural products of our contingency-based model of coordination.]  To begin, we will consider the simplest examples of coordination: those where the actions of agents are determined only by the external state (the jointly observable component) and the last action of the other agent.    Need to assume cooperativity, No internal state in a reactive system. In this initial case, the other agent is a purely reactive system, a stimulus-response agent.   I have an intended Markov transition, I want to infer whether you conformed to my intentions.   Initial definition of coordination: Actions are defined as state transitions.  My intentions are defined by an equivalence class of state transitions. Coordination is achieved when your action is contained in my intentions.  The intended contribution of a signal is the set of acceptable state transitions for an agent. The meaning of a signal is the set of state transitions that an agent would deem to be consistent with the signal. We have the same meaning when your equivalence class is the same as my equivalence class.  But we need to take into account negotiation: Acceptable actions with respect to the goal are also defined by an equivalence class of state transitions. Coordination (or cooperation) with me is achieved when your action is contained in my set of acceptable actions. Negotiation occurs when your action is initially outside of my intentions, but is within my set of acceptable actions.  [Is there any reason to have this initial intentions and negotiation in general model? Are they simply mechanisms by which we reduce the complexity of the computation by separating the prediction and verification mechanisms?] [Introduce the notion of a coordinating structure. This is what you coordinate on. It should be introduced in a sufficiently general way such that it captures the simple structures used initially, but makes room for more abstract structures.] An additional and important consideration, especially for later extensions of our model of coordination, is the notion of a coordinating structure. A coordinating structure is what the agents coordinate on. A coordinating structure determines the set of acceptable actions for each agent in the coordination scenario. The set of acceptable actions may or may not be the same for each party, but each agent must agree upon the set of acceptable actions for the other agents including himself. Such a structure must be mutually agreed upon implicitly, as the set of actions you perform must align with the set of actions I find it acceptable for you to perform and vice versa. In the simplest case, the coordination structure is simply the set of sets of acceptable actions for each agent applied to the other agents. [Should graphically illustrate this], but in more complex cases, the coordinating structure can determine these sets of acceptable actions in another way. The coordinating structure captures the essence of the coordination scenario and coordination is achieved if and only if the each agent\u2019s actions are in accord with those specified by the coordinating principle throughout the coordination scenario. (Maybe note the similarity to Clark\u2019s notion of common ground and how this will help us to capture common ground and how it is established later in a principled formal manner.) [Also need a distribution over action salience. Need to figure out how this relates to the structure, the principle, and the scenario.] [Coordinating structure is the board in a chess game.] [Need to define coordination scenario] Furthermore: To understand a signal is to intend to perform an action or action sequence that is within the other agent\u2019s acceptable action set for that signal. Understanding a signal and performing this intended action successfully is therefore to successfully coordinate.  [He thinks that to understand a signal is to understand the intended set, but to coordinate is to perform something within the acceptable set. Consider this distinction.]  A simple example of non-coordination occurs when, given the mutual goal that we want to build a tower of blocks, I say, \u201cput the blue block on the ground.\u201d There are multiple blue blocks of different sizes so you put the small blue block on the ground. However, I know that a tower needs to be started with the largest block and therefore I intended the largest blue block as the referent of my expression. Your action is consistent with my utterance meaning, but is not in line with my intended contribution, nor does it result in coordination as it is outside my intention set.  However, let us instead imagine that, equal in size to the largest blue block is a red block. In response to my utterance, \u201cput the blue block on the ground,\u201d you put the largest red block on the ground. Though this is inconsistent with the meaning of the utterance, it is within my set of acceptable state transitions, because all I care about is the fact that the largest block gets put on the ground. This is an example of negotiation.  But the inference about coordination success can progress gradually. Let us instead imagine that I tell you \u201cbuild a tower of blocks alternating between red and blue,\u201d and that all of the blocks are the same size. You begin by placing a blue block on the ground. At this point you appear to in coordination, although I gain very little information about whether you are in coordination, as your only initial action that could have been inconsistent with this utterance would be to abstain from placing any blocks at all. You then put a second red block on top of the first. You still appear to be in coordination, and now I am more likely to believe that you understood my utterance. You then put a blue block on top and my inferred probability of understanding continues to rise. This is because it is increasingly unlikely, as you continue to perform actions consistent with my intentions, that your conforming to my intentions is a suspicious coincidence. It becomes increasingly likely that it is due to understanding my signal. If you complete the tower with a fourth red block, then you have successfully coordinated with me. If instead, you complete the tower with a fourth blue block, then, despite my earlier predictions, you have failed to conform.   We will see later, both theoretically and empirically, that we interpret utterances, not on their form alone, but on the contingency between the utterance and the state, and more precisely, between the utterances and various important properties of the state such as common ground, beliefs, desires, inferences about the beliefs of the other agent, goals, and more. Though this is equivalent in a mathematical sense to saying that an utterance is interpreted in terms of the context, factoring this relationship into contingencies yields a much clearer picture of the role of the context and on how to incorporate contextual inference into both theoretical and practical coordination and communication systems.   [Discuss the factorization of the contingencies and causation.]   [The action is an ephemeral state property, and the external state is a set of persistent state properties. Any information or interaction caused by ephemeral state properties only have effects beyond the current time step if they are incorporated into the persistent components of the state.]  In addition to these highly simplified experimental tasks, we can also show that this framework applies very naturally to a variety of real-world communication and coordination scenarios. [Discuss the examples (chess, Chipotle, etc.) from the frame of this formal model] [Sheep herding as coordination?]  [Do this with Blackjack and a set of alternative point goals. \u201cIn their country, in each casino people play blackjack to a different number.\u201d This will provide an illustrative instance of goal inference and alignment.] We can demonstrate the wide applicability of even this extremely simplified model of coordination by applying it to a set of scenarios. The first scenario is a chess game between two players. Where a Lewis-style model of coordination was applied only to Von Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s games of pure coordination, we can apply ours to a wider range of more adversarial games such as chess (though it may be possible to do the same with theirs). The key to this lies in the realization that players in a game of chess must still hold to our assumption about cooperativity, which in this case is with respect to the rules of the game. When coordinating in a game such as chess, the coordination is not at the level of the pay-offs of the individual moves, but in playing by the rules. When I make a move, I do not make an arbitrary one, but only those that I believe are deemed legal by the mutually and implicitly agreed upon set of rules defined by chess.  We model chess similarly to how we modeled the example of telling someone to build a tower. By beginning the game, each player begins with a set of acceptable actions that the other player is to follow. It just so happens that this set of acceptable actions is often the same for both players and that for each player, the set of acceptable actions they impose on the other player is the same as the set that they impose on themselves. This is not a necessary feature of the model, but a property of the game of chess and of a larger class of coordination scenarios where the set of rules one imposes on one\u2019s own actions is the same as the set that they expect the other agent to follow. Due to the structure of chess, this property is essential to keep the game fair. What is different about chess from the block stacking game is that the set of acceptable actions changes at each move. Just like in our more general model, this set is dependent on the external state of the world. However, the set of acceptable actions is defined on a higher level coordinating structure, namely the set of rules of the game. Though, throughout the game, we always expect the other agent to play by the rules, the rules impose a different set of acceptable actions on different states of the game (in chess the game state is almost entirely captured by the state of the board, but not entirely due to castling and en passant). This property of an abstract coordinating structure is but a simple extension to the more basic coordination problem. In the case of an abstract coordinating structure, the set of acceptable actions is simply specified by the abstraction coordinated upon instead of directly. We can work through an example of a chess game to better illustrate this principle. We will take the perspective of a player A, whose opponent is player B. Though we only take one perspective in this game, it is worth noting that the other perspective plays out in exactly the same way, simply with respect to his own set of intentions and acceptable actions.  [Play out the chess game to illustrate the abstract coordination structure. Additionally, it may be helpful to do a Bayesian analysis of this to capture the agent\u2019s calculated probability of coordination upon a set of rules. It may also be useful to go through how an agent might learn about the transition probabilities in this simple model to make it easier to later add a more complex one.] \u2026 [This next section is on modeling with a Bayesian approach] Because of the higher-order coordination structure involved in chess (namely, the rules), a simple observation of the contingencies between states and actions is not sufficient to confirm coordination. This is because the coordination structures and therefore the coordination scenarios do not persist for a single action like in the first block stacking example, but for a series of actions in an extended coordination scenario. Because of this extension into multi-turn coordination scenarios, coordination must be inferred by observing whether agents continue to act within the set of acceptable actions as determined by the coordination structure. In the case of chess, this is equivalent to the observation of whether your opponent continues to act within your understanding of the rules.  Instead of simply observing whether the other agent\u2019s actions were so far consistent with the coordinating structure, we might want to infer the likelihood that they are operating in accordance with the coordinating structure. This is equivalent to inferring the probability that the other agent is in coordination with you: often an important inference to make. In order to do this, we can take a classical Bayesian approach, which fits the scenario quite nicely and is equivalent to an information-theoretic approach that we will not illustrate (I think it is equivalent).  We can begin by imagining the set of acceptable actions as a hypothesis about the rule guiding the behavior of the other agent. If it is indeed the case that the other agent is in coordination with me, his actions will be governed by the set of acceptable actions determined by the coordination structure. [The other agent\u2019s choice of action with respect to the coordination structure is not uniform in the set of acceptable actions, but guided by other goals. These goals need to be taken into account when doing inference. Because of this, I may wish to introduce this Bayesian framework first with respect to the block stacking scenario and then later extend it to take into account this joint inference between coordination and goal.] [For the joint inference between goal and coordination: Given a constraint and a goal, we have a probability distribution over actions. Given an action, we have a probability distribution over a constraint and a goal? Given a set of actions, we can do joint inference? It is possible that the action of the agent would have been optimal for a variety of constraints given a goal, but it is also possible that it would not. It is possible that the action of an agent would be optimal for a variety of goals given a constraint, but it is also possible that it would not.] [Go through the Bayesian approach including the alternate hypotheses, the size principle, the prior probabilities, etc.]    [Discuss the Chipotle game and coordinating on a set of ordering procedures. This game involves an expectation set and a set of acceptable actions as well as an asymmetry between the two players that illustrates asymmetric coordination structures. It also provides an opportunity to further emphasize the importance of contingencies.] [Discuss cases where the coordination structures are exchangeable] [Discuss cases where the coordination structures are not exchangeable, but are exchangeable with respect to the observed data] [Discuss how this becomes unlikely when there is complex cross-checking and interdependency] [Philosophically discuss how the cases that are not dissociable and are exchangeable correspond to inference about phenomenological properties such as color phenomena.]  Why this model is not general and generalizing the model by introducing the notion of generalization (and the hidden state) Though the scenarios so far have been captured in large part by our simplified model of coordination, there is a large class of scenarios that are more complicated and cannot be captured in this way. Moreover, the set of scenarios so far were also analyzable with respect to the classical and generally-accepted model of coordination introduced by David Lewis\u2019 Convention. We will show that the ones that follow are not and that only our model can be extended in a simple and natural way to capture the unsofarcaptured aspects.  A simple scenario that defies prediction by our model involves that of a patient in a doctor\u2019s office.   [Need to show later how the state machine model of an agent can be factored into a simple MDP for an agent (I think mostly?) and how the addition of an interior state generalizes it to a POMDP (Again I think mostly?).] [Potentially add a note about the perspectives imposed by such a model and how each model captures the perspective of an agent who is a part of a larger system.]    [How are coordination structures set up? They are set up through communication in the same way that they are verified. Go through a set of examples and work through this duality of set-up and use of coordination structures and show how it enables a fluid process by which we can communicate and coordinate. Talk about this process in a discourse and with language. This setting up of coordination structures enables the communication and constant verification of coordination structures. ] [An utterance sets up a coordination structure by imposing a set of expected and acceptable responses on the other person. These expectations lie solely in the mind of the utterer or first party. The other person then responds to the utterance according to their interpretation of its meaning. This interpretation lies entirely within the second party. If the response is within the set of acceptable actions set by the first party, then an instance of coordination has occurred. If all the responses that the second party considered appropriate (and may have performed counterfactually) are in the set of acceptable responses of the first party and if the entire set of acceptable responses of the first party is contained within the set of actions the second party considered appropriate, then there is perfect conceptual alignment between the first party and the second party with respect to the meaning of the utterance of the first party.][I should express this formally in set theoretic and logical terms.] Perhaps move this to the beginning: [Inferring the coordination of the other party is closely related to asking \u201cdid they understand me?\u201d To infer this understanding, there are a number of things that must be taken into account. First is: What do you expect them do understand and what do you expect them to do given this understanding? Are these expectations for a single action? Or for a longer period of time? While they are acting, it is most important to ask: Is what they are doing consistent with an understanding of what I said or attempted to communicate? If so, you can ask: How much evidence does their action give about whether they understand or not? The strength of this evidence is dependent on a number of factors including their goals, the size of the set of the possible actions, the size of the set of consistent actions, and the probabilities of each of the actions independent of the context and goals and given the context and goals, but the key thing to compute is the probability that they would have committed that action given that they did not understand you. If you can compute this, then it is simple to infer whether they did understand you. Of course, if they commit a series of actions, then this evidence accumulates. This can all be elegantly captured using Bayesian probability.]  [We can also use the dual nature of actions in setting up coordination structures and in assessing coordination to argue that the model captures a smooth transition between language acquisition and language use not present in traditional formal accounts. It accounts for phenomena such as discourse alignment and intraconversational allusion where people learn and agree upon usages of words on the fly in a discourse. This is a phenomenon not presently captured in any formal account of communication.]  [How does this relate to theory of mind? Perhaps discuss the with the doctor patient example?]  [What about the case where you do not believe someone that they understand you? Simply ask them to extrapolate beyond what you gave them. If they provide a detailed extrapolation that is a priori unlikely to be generated (not generally applicable) that is consistent with your understanding, then it is extremely unlikely that they generated this without understanding you. This is how we verify understanding, at least in a highly explicit manner.]  [I aim to provide a synchronic account of communication in general.] [How can we form this model into an NLP framework?]  [We want to subsume and clarify and/or to contradict and give evidence for our version.]  [Perhaps I need to briefly discuss my modeling philosophy: that the analytic model should mirror the synthetic phenomena in parallel, and should provide sufficient flexibility to capture the observed phenomena and avoid unmotivated formal and analytic structures that diverge from the empirical.]   [Note that this theory does not require having a plan. Therefore it enables fluent coordination]   [Predicting what will be said is not required, but improves efficiency. This is a generative model. Nonpredictive coordination only requires a discriminative model.]

V Holiday Training \u2013 New College Men, Easter Holidays 2013 	 Firstly well done to everyone at Torpids!  M1 \u2013 A really solid first day, keeping pace with Worcester who ended up with blades, getting several places into Div 1. Day 2 is what cost us, a sloppy build up to the race led to a bump by Lincoln. Day 3 saw a massive improvement and a fantastic effort for everyone, and we were desperately unlucky that Lincoln managed to get LMH before we bumped them, and in the ensuing chase of LMH, Teddy Hall managed to sneak up behind and get the bump. Day 4 was another solid row over, with perhaps the crew suffering after the efforts of Day 3. What is clear to me is that we have good pace and are showing great potential, and with a relatively inexperienced crew, consistency will come when we start getting more time on the water. I think on balance you deserved to be 1 place up rather than 2 places down, it was not being quite switched on on Day 2 that cost us. But remember that we always said Summer Eights was the target, Torpids would be what it would be, and we will learn from everything that happened. Considering we did our first racing starts/race pace bursts 5 days before Torpids (first EVER for Pete and Benni!), overall you guys did brilliantly!  M2 \u2013 Did fantastically to hold their own and maintain position amongst 1st crews and 2nd crews from the top 5 colleges! I am really encouraged by the depth we have, and this bodes well for Summer Eights and next season. This crew showed great heart and enthusiasm, well done!  M3 \u2013 I feel gutted for the guys who put in hard yards at training and missed out on rowing at Torpids \u2013 guys it is a real priority now for us to get you up and running next term so that you can be out there competing at Summer Eights! Keep up the good work, and keep pushing for places in M2 or even M1!  Remember that selection starts again on the first day of next term, everyone will get a fair shot \u2013 I will obviously be looking at erg scores, and we should have much more water time so I\u2019ll get to assess people more technically.  It is a common issue with College crews that people get fit during term time, and then lose all their hard work during the holidays, having to pretty much start again the following term! Guys it is much harder to gain fitness than lose it! If you can keep yourself going over the holidays, it will make a MASSIVE difference, both to your chances of being in the crew you are aiming for, but more importantly, to our results as a squad at Summer Eights. Let\u2019s keep working through the holidays, not just for ourselves but also for each other \u2013 we can really gain an advantage if we are more committed to maintaining/improving our fitness before next term. So below is a \u2018menu\u2019 style program \u2013 let me know if you have any questions!  These are guidelines. I accept that people have access to different facilities \u2013 very limited for some! If you have some other sporting activities going on \u2013 great! The key is regularity \u2013 keeping your cardiovascular fitness at the very least at the same level, and starting to develop your anaerobic fitness and lactate tolerance.  I haven\u2019t included strength training, as we don\u2019t usually have access to weights. If you do know what you\u2019re doing in terms of lifting weights, any strength training you do will be beneficial \u2013 particularly lower body and core. If anyone would like an individual strength program, I am happy to discuss this with them.  Ensure that you stretch properly for 10mins after each session, and if you have access to ergos, do the slide build (from both ends of stroke) warm up before starting as we have done through this term.  I would recommend that you do 20mins of core stability/core strength work every day (1 day off per week). If anyone wants a core program, I am happy to discuss putting one together on an individual basis.  5 sessions per week is really a minimum if we\u2019re serious about competing strongly at summer eights. 5 x 60-90 mins per week should be possible for most people. If you want to do more than that (eg if you want to move up a crew) then by all means go for it! Just ensure that you leave enough recovery time between Group 2 sessions. Obviously if you\u2019re away skiing etc I understand that you won\u2019t be able to train then \u2013 but that\u2019s good exercise anyway!   Group 1: x 3 per week (pick ones that suit your situation best) 50-60min steady state run 50-60min steady state swim 70-90min steady state bike 45min run 8min steady (warm up) (5mins @ 80-90%/3mins light) x 4 5min cool down Swim 10 lengths steady (warm up) 4 lengths @ 80-90%, 2 lengths light Repeat x 10 5 lengths cool down Bike 10min steady warm up (7min @ 80-90%/3min light) x 5 5min cool down Ergo Normal slide build warm up (10min) 4 x 12min (5\u2019@18/4\u2019@20/3\u2019@22), 3min recovery between each Ensure your split drops as rate increases (70% - 80% - 90%) Looking for consistency through the pieces (technique and splits) 3-5min cool down Ergo 30min Rate 20 (max effort) Ergo Normal slide build warm up (10min) 4 x 2k @ Rate 22-24, 5min recovery between each \u2013 firm pressure, but looking for consistency through the pieces   Group 2: x 2 per week (min of 48hrs between them)  Run 10min steady warm up (2min hard (90-100%), 2min light jog/walk) x 8 5min cool down Swim 10 lengths steady warm up (2 lengths hard/1min rest) x 12 5 lengths cool down Bike 10min steady warm up Pyramid \u2013 1min hard/1min light\u2026..2mins hard/2mins light\u2026.etc, up to 5mins, back down. \u2018Hard\u2019 should be max effort for that amount of time, \u2018light\u2019 means very light pressure but keep moving \u2013 active recovery. Will take 50mins total. 5mins cool down (erg/walk/jog). Ergo Normal slide build warm up (10min), plus a few 10 stroke bursts at full pressure (rate 26-30) 6 x 500m (2 @ r26, 2 @ r28, 2 @ r30) \u2013 max pressure 90sec recovery between each Ergo Normal slide build warm up (10min), plus a few 10 stroke bursts at full pressure (rate 26-30) 3 x 1500m (500@26/500@28/500@30) \u2013 max pressure 3mins recovery between each Ergo Normal slide build warm up (10min), plus a few 10 stroke bursts at full pressure (rate 20-24) (30secs on/20secs off, FULL pressure \u2013 power strokes at rate 20-24) x 10 3mins recovery Repeat x 2   Any questions \u2013 let me know!  We will have ergo tests on the first week back. These will be in the form of 2 x 1k (free rate), with a 4min recovery between each \u2013 same as this term. I will be looking at the combined scores of the 2 x 1k. So I suggest that you have a crack at that towards the end of the holiday so you have an idea what to aim for.   Have a great Easter everyone, I\u2019m really looking forward to the summer already!   Ben

V Write on what will be called: Exchangeability: the reason for the explanatory gap  The twin Earth example works for ordinary scenarios to explain referential meaning. The example, however, falls apart when we question the perfect exchangeability of the scenarios, since there is certainly a way in which we could distinguish XYZ from H2O. This may be used to argue, that, even though meaning is referential, one may still use evaluative processes to ensure that one is referring to the same thing as another. This is because, in the processes that are being talked about, there is not an absolute exchangeability between sets of possible worlds and observable properties, even if there is exchangeability between sets of possible worlds and observed properties. However, there do exist domains in which the observable properties of possible worlds are perfectly exchangeable, but in which the substance being referenced may be imagined to vary. I will therefore use this means of analysis to help us to understand the nature of language as referential, as well as the nature of these exchangeable worlds themselves.  Exchangeable worlds include: Other minds and external phenomena Skeptical cases such as the brain-in-a-vat scenario Any situation in which the difference between epistemically different worlds cannot be metaphysically distinguished  Micro-macro problem is a problem of complexity and emergence, not of unexplanation

V How can we verify that we are being understood? We can check to see if the interlocutor responds in a manner consistent with understanding. How can we verify that an interlocutor has the same understanding of a word as us? We can check to see if the interlocutor responds in a manner consistent with understanding across the spectrum of uses of this word. How can we use these checks to generalize about cases that we have not explicitly checked? We can infer their generalization through a variety of independent checks as well as inference based on their similarity to us and therefore the likely similarity of their inductive generalizations to ours.  1. To explore this verification process in 1, we can work through examples of coordinated action through language and examine the inferences made by the interlocutors about their mutual understanding. These coordinated action games are especially useful in that they are highly amenable to experiment. This verification can be generally captured through a framework of contingency observations. A contingency observation is the observation of the consequence Y, of a state or an input X. They can be formally expressed as antecedent-consequence pairs or tuples (X, Y) where the nature and representation of X and Y is left unspecified and might vary from that of a discrete random variable to a complex specification of a structured context. This unspecification is a particular power of the model in that it enables this analysis scheme to operate at a level of abstraction independent of the details of the events and actions, to capture only the observation of a relation. We will see the power of this representation later as we explore examples, and we will also see how such a representation enables a variety of interesting analyses and models including but not limited to hierarchical Bayesian inference.  Describe in more detail what I mean by contingency checking, what I hope to capture with contingency checking, and what it looks like in an abstract case.  Our first example of contingency checking will be two agents playing a board game such as chess. These agents are new at chess and therefore the simplicity and ignorance of their moves can be forgiven. In chess, the expectation is that players take turns moving pieces on the board in manners that are deemed legal by a set of rules that is implicitly mutually agreed upon when both participants begin playing. Chess is a simple example because the thing that is being checked is not a consistency with a highly complex and hard to capture scenario-dependent set of expectations and consistent behavior, but in chess these things are comparatively simple. The set of rules is explicitly defined, and the set of expectations is relatively simple. Here we will analyze how a chess player judges whether his opponent understands the scenario and is cooperating with the gameplay. If the player A makes a move, there are many things that player B might do. It is useful to sort these behaviors into a typology of three categories, those that A expects, those that A does not expect, but are consistent with A\u2019s understanding of what is cooperative, and those that are understood by A to be uncooperative. As a simplified scenario, let us consider the case where player A has a king and a rook and where player B has only a king. If player A moves her rook adjacent to player B\u2019s king to put player B in check (and A\u2019s king is on the other side of the board), player B has a variety of possible actions. If player B responds by capturing player A\u2019s rook, then this is a move that is consistent with player A\u2019s expectations and player A has no reason to believe that player B is not playing cooperatively within the framework of the game, nor that player B misunderstands the rules of the game.  Player B might also move his king to get out of check without capturing the rook. Though player A may not expect this because it is a highly suboptimal move in this case, it is within the rules and player A has no reason to believe that player B is being uncooperative, but perhaps simply that player B is not particularly proficient at achieving his goal of eventually capturing A\u2019s king. Player B might also move his king across the board to capture player A\u2019s king. Player A would both not expect this move and would reason that this move is inconsistent with respect to the scenario. Player A might then infer that player B either does not understand the rules of the game, or that he is being uncooperative. The nature of this inference is dependent on context and prior observations. If player B had been moving his king within the rules for the entire game, then it would be a suspicious coincidence if he happened to not know the rules for king movement, especially if it would have benefitted him to move outside of the rules previously. A might infer of course that B had a complex understanding of the rules such that this kind of king movement is legal only under the present conditions, but the prior probability of this hypothesis is relatively low, and so the alternative that B is playing uncooperatively becomes the dominant hypothesis by A. Additionally, if player B had been flouting other rules all game, A would reasonably infer that B is not familiar with the game rules. Introduce three types of contingencies Discuss examples of behavior of the opponent B, given a move by the player A and how the player A interprets these behaviors with respect to intention to cooperate/understanding of the rules of the game. Show how this is formalized in the contingency notation  (three types of contingency responses: the expected, the unexpected but consistent, the inconsistent)  Expected: plays a move after you play a move Unexpected, but consistent: goes to the bathroom after you play a move Inconsistent: plays two moves after you play a move.   Chess game Introductory for the notation and for the three types of contingency interpretations Not particularly good evidence for why contingencies are the quantity of interest Ordering at Chipotle Demonstrates contingencies based on the station. i.e. given \u201cblack or pinto beans?\u201d the interpretations are different from given \u201cchicken, steak, or veggie?\u201d Still retains a relatively simple space and representation \u2026 Demonstrates how we can use contingencies alongside similarity assumptions to explicitly infer others\u2019 mental states Turing test Then try to argue that this is general for discourse. Then try to argue that this is a general model of communication and that it captures essential features such as inference about interlocutor interpretation that are not captured in an information-theoretic communication signaling communication model.  There are two reasons why cues are not sufficient: It is possible that people think that they understand and they do not and therefore they do not send a cue of misunderstanding. (Also a misunderstanding cue is sent only when a misunderstanding is inferred, which leaves open the question of how misunderstanding is inferred in the first place This can be done via textual media without these multimodal cues. To explain this, we either need to appeal to subtle embedded cues or to other mechanisms.    Need to explain the role of individual subcomponents of language So far we have treated linguistic utterances as units without decomposing them into the constitutive components that comprise them. This has helped us to understand language at a macro level and how utterances are understood in terms of the changes they cause in the state of the discourse system. This approach yields an important high-level feedback mechanism for macro-scale linguistic units and enables us to explain how the meaning of an expression may productively differ from a rule-derived compositional meaning formed from subcomponents. However, individual words and grammatical relations have meaning, and this meaning plays an important role, both in how these utterances are generated and in how language is learned. We do not learn language by memorizing the effects of utterances and using these utterances, but by extracting meanings and meaning components that tie to morphemes, constructions, relations with context, &c. This is what enables us to generate novel expressions and to use language to express novel thoughts and ideas. In this section we will explore the nature of these compositional mechanisms and how they relate to the picture we have drawn of language as a set of contingency relations between sound, text, and mind.

V From Social interactions to psychology to mathematics, all disciplines may function only because they make assumptions about their basic premises. Philosophy, however, is the discipline that claims to feign assumptions in favor of a higher truth. Unfortunately, for the field to function, assumptions are still made all of the time, but they are often unnoticed. This allows them to silently corrupt the field and understanding in general. The way to fix this is to make assumptions, but only the most basic, general, and reasonable assumptions and to build off these. Of course these assumptions may be changed later, but when they are changed, everything must be re-derived from scratch in order to preserve internal consistency.

V How do we get abstract structured hierarchical inductions from a stream of sensation?  Hierarchical causal bayes nets and probabilistic logic  She thinks it is definitive that children infer causal relations from statistical patterns.  Unanswered question: \u201cHow do children search through all the possible hypotheses?\u201d I CAN HELP HERE Basically I will prove the sufficiency of cognitive salience explanations.  More and less complex hypotheses. How do we choose between them?  Priors are the same for adults and children. However adults are more likely to shift. They are generalizing differently though. They have a different abstract prior.  She claims that sampling helps with hypothesis choice. However, this still requires a set of hypotheses under consideration for sampling\u2026 Read Vul and Pashler 2008 \u201cSampling in adults\u201d Read: \u201csampling as a solution to the search problem in computer science: Markov Chain Monte Carlo, particle filters\u201d Read: \u201cSampling in Cognitive Development\u201d ALL OF THESE ARE SUCCECEPTABLE TO THE GENERALIZATION PROBLEM  WE CAN IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT ABSTRACT BIAS AND THEREFORE THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY LEARN THESE CONCEPTS. THE ONLY WAY TO SHOW THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM IS TO DO THE COMMUNICATIVE INDUCTIVE BIAS THING.  She says high temperature search vs. low temperature search as difference in weighting between consideration of different probability hypotheses. But what determines the probability of each hypotheses? These still require priors!!!!!!!  Simulated annealing doesn\u2019t fix anything!!!!!! AHHHH. An exploration exploitation tradeoff is not the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!   Read: Lombrozo: generating explanations prompts adults to privilege broad generalizations   She thinks that \u201cchildhood is evolution\u2019s way of preforming simulated annealing.\u201d Which does not account for the full generalization problem, but does account for relative flexibility and cultural differences. This could be a very useful point to add to my argument!!!

V Flashing your high beams at another car is almost always interpreted as a signal, especially if it is done multiple times (important to expand this repeatedness in terms of contingencies). The signal is highly ambiguous w.r.t. conventional meaning.   I want to use this signal and a set of associated scenarios to compare the inferential contingency model with the traditional rules and context model.    Possible meanings of signals and associated contexts/contingencies:  Your brake lights are out You have reason to suspect that your brake lights are out The light is green You are going too slow Let me pass Go ahead first At a stop sign There is a cop There is a speed camera You have your high beams on If you are facing them I\u2019m behind you, trying to maneuver, and I need you to move up Requires me being behind you and having my turn signal on It\u2019s your friend Jim   The contingency model takes this signal as a clear signal, but with a meaning that is determined by your expectations as to what it might mean. These expectations are modulated by the scenario and the context in a manner that is often relatively straightforward. This straightforwardness comes from the fact that both parties have learned similar contingencies due to having the same human structure, being part of the same world, and having similar culture (and sometimes language community.) The scenario determines the likely meaning of the signal both due to the properties of the scenario that you have already incorporated into your internal state, and due to those that are accessible to you by looking externally. Since the model is fundamentally a causal one (we are trying to discover the reason for the signal and therefore its meaning), any remaining ambiguity is solved by causal inference. This might include performing behaviors that might ameliorate the reason behind the signal and to check whether the signal is repeated in these new circumstances. Perhaps you think it might be because there is a cop. Then you might check to see if you are speeding or look ahead for a cop car. Perhaps you think it might be because you are going too slow. Then you might check to see if there is a car following you closely or if you are indeed going below the speed of traffic. Perhaps you think it might be your friend Jim (likely to come after checking the other contingencies). Then you might look into the other car at the driver. You might also check the type of car if you know the car that he drives. The discriminability or information content of this signal, of course, varies dramatically based on how perceptually unique the car is (extra loud, a rare model, a specific dent, etc.) Perhaps you are stopped at a light. You might check to see whether the light is green. These things come after failure to disambiguate the signal based on internal knowledge. In these circumstances, you search for external knowledge.  Circumstances that are disambiguatable with prior knowledge alone are if you are at a stop sign or if you know that your lights are not working, etc.   In the signals and context model, the signal provides very minimal information here, since it applies to all of these possible meanings. We are left then with the context, which is an unfactored and highly ambiguous property. Even if the context does have structure, this theory still does not hold up in the case where there is residual ambiguity.   Basically, the scenario sets up expectations for meanings, and the signals are processed in terms of their likelihood to convey those meanings. It is a joint causal inference process that enable coordination between two individuals, not a simple signaling system.  Signals do not have strict meanings in themselves, but come to be associated with various meanings thought language use, which becomes similar across a community. These signals are therefore used to reduce ambiguity and to enable coordination and communication.

V I am going to begin with a problem that doesn\u2019t occur, at least not in its full fledged form. This non-occurrence is a particularly interesting feature of this problem, as its existence is predicted by most theories. As is clear in the scientific method, a conflict between theory and data most likely results in a required theoretical revision. We will see that this is the case. The problem is called conceptual misalignment and it is when the concepts or meanings that one agent associated with a set of symbols is different from the concepts or meanings that another agent associates with those same signals. It becomes a problem only when these two agents attempt to communicate using these symbols.  When this attempt at communication occurs, it looks like this:   You might disagree and say that this does occur, or you might contest my glossing over exactly what concepts and meanings are. I will address these things in due time, as my argument truly\u2014as you may have already discovered\u2014hinges upon these points.  Instead of delving right into detail, let us first explore what would happen if this were to occur, especially in a system as illustrated. Such a system has a discrete and independent set of meanings, which is to say that none of the meanings necessarily have anything to do with each other and that there are no shades of meaning, only binary or propositional meanings or concepts which are either transmitted or not. This picture looks a bit like communication in a computer and so we will start there.  If this conceptual misalignment were to occur in such a communicative system, the wrong meanings would simply be transmitted and the receiving system would probably throw some sort of fit or error or fail at whatever it was trying to do with the veridical results of this communication. As stated, such a system could not correct, nor could it realize that there was anything wrong because such behaviors require an understanding of what a correct message should look like or a meaning expectation. Without such an expectation, the receiving agent simply receives and does whatever it would do with a correctly transmitted message. Here we define a correctly transmitted message or perfect communication to be when the meaning held by the transmitting agent is grasped by the receiving agent through a communicative process, which traditionally takes the form of a signal. Perfect communication always occurs in such a system when the communicating agents are in perfect conceptual alignment, which is the state that occurs when both agents have exactly the same sets of meanings mapped to the same sets of signals. Of course this perfection is under the assumption of noiseless transmission, which will hold throughout this paper. I claim and will later show experimental evidence to defend the fact that the only agents that are ever in perfect conceptual alignment are digital computers and programs and things that were explicitly designed such that a signal will always map from the input to the output.  Now, you might say, HEY, there are many processes where perfect communication occurs without conceptual alignment. This is true, so let us explore.   Actually I am pretty sure that conceptual alignment is not required as much as knowledge of what the signal is signaling. In many cases this knowledge is acquired easily by observing the contingencies between the signal and the world such that we know what in the world causes such a signal and therefore can later rely on the signal as a signal for the thing in the world. However, in many cases this is not possible, since there is no way to directly observe the thing that is being signaled. In this cases, knowledge of what is being signaled by the signal must be acquired in some other manner. This manner involves complex conditional and causal inference.        talk about information theoretic models talk about prediction or schemas of meaning talk about meaning contingencies including the consistency of messages with respect to a set of hypotheses talk about interaction and causal inference ta

V I send you a message. I now have expectations as to how you will respond based on your interpretation. If your interpretation is acceptable with respect to what I believe the meaning to be, you will respond in a manner consistent with my understanding of acceptable responses to the message. If you do, then I gain evidence for conceptual alignment, successful communication, and successful coordination. If you do not, then I gain evidence against conceptual alignment, successful communication, and successful coordination.  These models and the accompanying theory are a large step beyond the current coordination game framework because it accounts for the dynamic inference character of communication. We are not just reasoning about utterances in isolation, whether it be about their literal meanings or their speaker meanings, but about the ways that these utterances were interpreted by our actual interlocutors.   We can also illustrate the other side of this, where you send me a signal or utter an utterance directed towards me. In this case, I am reasoning about the meaning of your utterance with respect to earlier contextual constraints. These can be built from my last utterance to you, previously established common ground, other joint knowledge such as that which is perceivable in the environment, and other inferences I can make about your goals. All of this can weigh into what I expect you to mean by what you say. If I can find a hypothesis for your meaning consistent with your utterance and with my understanding of the context, then I have found a possible meaning that you are attempting to transmit. If I cannot, then perhaps I need to gain more information and I may probe you for some. Here we can see that utterance understanding is a process, not of game theoretic alignment, but of mutual dynamic inference. Human communication and coordination in general is such a process.

V Though coordination games are a powerful framework, they cannot account for many important phenomena in coordination and communication. Moreover, most models of communication do not bear on coordination as a general process, but presuppose coordination between agents that sets up the signaling systems, which then do the communicative work. Among many problems, this requires a divide between language acquisition and use, limits the flexibility of communicative processes, and fails to capture how we can infer things about others\u2019 mental states.  In a coordination model, we want to account for how people\u2019s inferences about each others\u2019 mental states and the reasons behind their production of signals and actions relates to communication. We also wish to determine a minimum interaction required for coordination between individuals and to model the maximum amount of misalignment between thoughts and intentions that is tolerable when coordinating.   We treat both the Wittgenstinian view that coordination is a function on actions, as well as a more cognitively inspired view that coordination, though expressed and viewed in the language of actions, is fundamentally a cognitive phenomenon that operates on \u201cmental states\u201d. In order to accommodate this later perspective, we use tools from generalization theory in the artificial intelligence realm and counterfactual analysis from the philosophical realm to articulate both what it means to successfully coordinate in a given instance and what it means to be in coordination in general.  Just as in coordination game models, we do not put constraints on the form of speech acts, nor do we provide a theory of linguistic meaning. Instead, we treat speech acts simply as signals. However, in contrast to coordination games, our model does not claim that signals have an explicit meaning that has been previously coordinated on (wither directly or through coordinating on abstract structures such as grammars), but that signals guide inferences about the mental states of others and therefore the likelihoods of future actions that they might produce. We argue that this view can accommodate the highly regular communicative functions of languages well-established in a community and the ad-hoc coordination and communication we observe all the time. Additionally, we capture mental states without representational claims, but in what we will prove to be a fully general Bayesian framework. In order to argue for this nonrepresentationality and generality, we make use of some proofs from generalization theory as well as demonstrate a few cases of how this form of representation maps cleanly onto others.  We also provide examples of coordination scenarios and use them to illustrate the principles of the theory/model at work.

V Jurafsky talk  Language has to do with what people mean, not with what words mean. Rough Herb Clark quote.  Paper is dist over topic and topic is dist over words for his model.  He looks at people over time instead of   He says eeepox for epochs  \u201cNLP is maturing to the point where we have tools that are useful for something\u201d Jurafsky  Linguistic freezing in language of older speakers Younger users innovate. Older users freeze. Can we build this into my chaotic dynamical systems model of language change. Users freeze their language in the community\u2019s past.

V Leon Bergen @ Levy Lab Meeting  Claims that languages have meaning units and compositional rules\u2026 CHOMSKY But what about meaning that emerges from interaction?? And ad-hoc meaning? He has quite the cognitively naiive perspective on language\u2026  What if syntax simply does not contain a sufficient amount of information to capture the regularities in language? Then we need a linguistic theory that operates at a different level such as a semantic level, or a communication level\u2026 [my thought]   Statistical information might yield information about the argument-modifier distinction apparently  He claims that we prefer grammars that generate the corpus using as few tree fragments as possible And possibly also context-free grammar rules  Also, we prefer to use the same tree fragments as often as we can. This is done by the Chinese restaurant process, which wants to concentrate as much probability mass as possible on as few tables as possible.  Also want to minimize the rule tokens used to generate each sentence  powerpoint

V Which naming moments matter  Trueswell and Gleitman, proposean dverif, strong hypothesis testing, no aggregation  Statistical leaning, finding structure in lots of data  Three solutions to the ref uncertainty problem Constraints (word learning biases) that operate on noisy data to make it clean (e.g. mutual exclusivity, whole object bias) 2. Statistical learning Learn only from unambiguous moments   How does one put the quality of naming moments into the statistical word learning mechanism?  What about biases in statistical learning?  Just counting co-occurances does a pretty good job.  There are a lot of models that work on real word data and still work. Many ways to make this work and to find the structure in the data.  Blocked presentation breaks the cross-situational word learning effect.  Changing salience and systematic sampling breaks word learning.  Do only the high quality naming events matter? Or is there more?  She shows best vs. worst naming events. They don\u2019t predict learning. The whole distribution, however, does predict learning. Number of naming events also does not have an effect Do the cooccurence data themselves provide useful information?  Perceptual statistics are stronger than simple statistics (perceptual takes into account size in visual field, simple is just cooccurence)  Relative size (vs. distractor) vs. absolute size in visual field. Absolute size is winner takes all size for the largest object. Absolute works better. Shows that we aggregate only the things that are big enough to be noticed!  The power of a good statistical learner is based on what data is thrown out. Less information can be more powerful. This is due to the fact that the bias is stronger towards the relevant thing to learn.   They then try a model counting objects above a threshold vs. a relative threshold model vs. an absolute threshold model.  This is actually a halfway point between using only the best trials and using statistical learning.  There are also probably temporal coherence properties (attention across time)  Ideal learning systems are slow to decide because there is a significant cost to false commitments.

V Science is limited by the questions we ask and the questions we ask are limited by what we know or what we think we know.  The sensorymotor system puts constraints on the visual input and therefore on what is learned.  Referential ambiguity. Too many potential referents. This is a problem for word learning. (quine\u2019s paradox) (But similarity of inductive bias!!!)  Children are capable of inferring a speaker\u2019s intent with social cues. Innate and learned beliefs and biases about how words map to referents.   Sensory-motor processes play a role in reducing the ambiguity. BABIES AND THIR SENSORYMOTOR SYSTEMS ARE NOT AT ALL LIKE US.  Cognitive accounts assume that there is a core cognitive system that is shared by infants and adults.  However, they are not like us in their sensorymotor systems.   Sensorymotor patterns of the baby are much more dynamic than that of the parent.   Babies bring things into view closely. Babies have short arms. Babies grab and play with things.  Children have dominating objects moreso than adults.  Dual eyetracking data of fixation data parent vs. child shows massive differences between child and parents.   Children have more sticky attention than parents.   Having one object in view significantly reduces visual clutter and creates an optimal moment for object-word learning.  She really specifically describes how to find the signal in the noise and the structure of the signal and the noise.  The learned object name is visually larger than the competitor. It overlaps with center more. These begin before the naming event and persists after the naming event. THIS IS VERY REMINISCENT OF THE KRIPKIAN BAPTIZATION PROCESS. But how is generalization done? Kripkian baptization works for proper names, but it requires more for object category name learning.   Children learn when object is visually bigger and more salient and this difference between the competitor is there before and after the event. Also head and eye alignment predicts visual word learning.  Important question: Does mom know that the good naming moments for the child are good naming moments for the child?  What predicts when parents name objects? What predicts when infants learn?  The scene properties that predict when mom names should be the same as those that predict when children learn (for optimal teaching).  She is very honest about the structure of her data.  The properties that tell parents to name to not appear to be the same as those that are good for the children to learn.  Mom can never know the visual properties most critical for the child to learn because she is not the learner.  We need to study more about the visual stimulus for visual word learning since this is extremely important.  She doesn\u2019t think that joint attention has much to do with word learning.  The problem isn\u2019t referential ambiguity. (but really the referential ambiguity problem is solved by the fact that the referent is dominant in the visual system in the visual system.)   She doesn\u2019t know where to go with the biases approach. She thinks that cognitive concepts are irreducible a la Fodor.   She thinks that the magnified view is incommensurate with the magnified view of cognition. 	 She sees no relevance between the macro-level hypotheses and the sensory-motor data.  We should actually think about the sensorymotor work as showing how children avoid the referential ambiguity problem.  I would argue that folk psychological terms are adding a connection to our other thoughts and theories about cognition. It doesn\u2019t necessarily add conceptual content in itself, but it helps us to relate this work to previous thought on it. You are elaborating on the important features of what we would call interest and how these features affect word learning.

V All knowledge in the brain is stored in patterns of connections There are also associations between modality processing areas.  Is it silly to say that a chair is awake? What about not awake? Predicability tree   He models knowledge as propositionally stored in connections. However, the knowledge is most likely generated from a lower level multimodal understanding of the concepts at hand.  He used ANNs with backpropagation just as I learned w/ Newman.   Learning is very slow. However, it could most likely be made quicker if there was a genetically determined staring point that was roughly where you want\u2026   Mcclelland pronounces epoch wrong\u2026   Neural network style learning is used in the cortex Fast and new learning is done in a separate medial temporal lobe system  A schema is an organized knowledge structure   New learning consistent with what we already know can be really fast. If inconsistent learning is much slower. (all of this is with ANNs)  \u201cYou need to build up some structure before you can build on that structure.\u201d \u2013Jay  The cortex can learn quickly with the help of the hippocampus (Amnesic patients cannot learn even schema-consistent facts quickly.)

V We can describe listeners as assuming that speakers are rational, not that speakers or people are rational. RSA algorithm can be applied to arbitrary signaling systems Provided a \u201csyntax\u201d and a \u201csemantics\u201d  Game theoretic models work to study equilibrium behavior  (And normative decisions) RSA more convenient to link to human behavior because they assign probabilities  Why is there differential cost to utterances with more expense to long utterances? Formally required   Mike has plate with carrot and banana stimuli.  Horowitz and Frank (2012/2014)  There is a cancelable implicature that we mark things linguistically because it is informative to mark them.   Can you manipulate the relative informativeness of the speaker??? Trust and testimonies studies are interetstign with repsect to speaker informativeness. \u201cThat\u2019s a cow!\u201d when it is really a duck.  Smith, Goodman, & Frank (2013) \u201cJohn got the car to stop.\u201d Yields an implicature   All OF THIS RELIES ON SIGNALLING SYSTEMS!!! Galantucci   No bias for shorter words to go with shorter things, only longer words go with longer things. There may be a horn (cost) implicature that shapes how lexical complexity maps to conceptual or referent complexity.  Talk to Cohen about the frame problem and about how to capture a more general theory of pragmatics and coordination that have not yet been captured by any formal models of pragmatics such as Horn or Levinson or Frank, etc.  Next generation is about joint inferences about signaling systems and the predictions derived from them.  Herb Clark talks about the gradual build-up of common ground.    He claims that speakers are not really captured by any models that he has.  Speakers tend to produce things in a greedy way based on the simplicity of production about things such as color over things like texture.  Relevance is about understanding the distribution over salience.

V Noah Goodman Cogs 200 Talk Uncertainty in language in thought  Church works in the \u201csampling semantics\u201d which is easier to compose than the associated mathematical notation.  Dippl.org and probmods.org  \u201c15 cups were dropped into a pool. How many of them do you think sank?\u201d  Then a slider bar  On the right side, the curve is being driven by the surprisingness of the utterance, and on the left side it is being driven by surprisingness of the world. Should think about whether this has anything to do with whether the world or the language is being informed?  If the speaker is drunken or in court trying to defend their friends as opposed to sober speakers, the wonkiness is attributed to the speaker and not to the world. This was an experiment that they ran.  \u201cDogs have fur\u201d vs. \u201cticks carry lime disease\u201d  \u201cThe value of tall is being set as to what the threshold would have had to be such that the utterance is true.\u201d But you also want to set the threshold such that the sentence would have been an informative thing to say.  Generics are things such as \u201cdogs have fur\u201d or \u201cMesquitos carry West Nile virus.\u201d But the generalities of these statements seems to vary by category from all to the minimal there exist some. Cimpian, et al 2010  The mesquitos carry Westnile is OK because most animals don\u2019t.  State, affect, rounded (as a model of QUD inference).   He is only cautiously optimistic about the prospects of his lexical uncertainty.  He is interested in multi-hierarchical scales of learning and change!!!   Also interested in learning the associations between words and QUDs. This could be modeled in a topic model type thing????  They measure the priors several different ways, and are ok with it only when they all agree do they use them.   How can we go from speaker unreliability to world unreliability.   Speakers do not do what the \u201crational speaker\u201d is doing because there is something that they have to do about the lexicon. Instead, make a model where there is a goal that the speaker has and the listener is trying to infer the goal. Shouldn\u2019t the other things that the speaker has be the knowledge of the speaker?? Or the beliefs of the speaker??  When do speakers describe things as tall??

V Notes for Gentner Talk whilst sitting next to Arturs  Similarities when the only thing that is shared is a relational patterns  \u201cRelational thinking is the key cognitive difference between us and other primates\u201d  Hofstadter\u2019s \u201cme too\u201d phenomenon  Premack\u2019s relational match-to-sample task is simple, but can only be done well by humans.   [We observe relations (analogical), and we link them to words. These are not, therefore, hierarchical feature-combination representations, but are tied directly. We can show this through an analogical learning experiment.] My thought  Not about number of features, but coherence of the structures. She has many example studies.  Language operates by analogy: she has many examples. Search \u201cbought a tire company\u201d  How can we do structure mapping without metric-space representations? Perhaps a causal structural mapping? What about for non-causal things? How can we deal with extraneous features? (This is done by the structure mapping model)  Inferences are done, after mapping, by pattern completion.  Analogy is a method of discovery, linguistically among other ways.   Analogy is a powerful tool for teaching and learning, as key important differences can be illustrated by comparable pairings. Cross-situational extraction of relations is modulated by invitation to compare.   Hypothesis testing for her means hypotheses in working memory.   Analogy as a structural alignment process  Perhaps a better model for conceptual alignment could make use of structural alignment processes?  Emergence of categories such as nouns and verbs comes from recognition of structural categories.  Carey and Bartlett 1978 \u2018Bring me the Chromium one, not the red one.\u2019  My so-called \u2018contrast learning\u2019 word learning scenarios, come from analogical mapping that enables alignment and therefore contrast. Gentner tests variable alignability. Alignability modulates contrastive word-learning. (study in progress.) High alignable group has more information, because there is only one difference.  In an ongoing study, high alignability is not conflated with level of information (see picture).  Kotovsky and Gentner 1986 things that are easy to align make the relation more salient and therefore enables recognition of this relation for more difficult cases. Verb learning     How does the model account for the toma cases? She says that it is a mystery. There is an interesting model to be built where relational information gets made salient and then labeled. This should be built by me. Argue that relational extraction is essential for abstraction. And show how this might occur. Does the model live in a metric space, or in a graph/network one?  Graph-theoretic models imply conceptual dependencies. Perhaps just associations?  Mapping is done by words. Her model requires a conceptual dependency theory. She gets at them via language. They are linguistically relational representations.   Ask here about CogSketch

V Interested in looking at both what is inside a person and what is outside of the person. Interested also on the interaction between these elements.  Can we look at contingency inferences as such an interactive perspective?   I want to work on a study of contingency inferences based on interactions between pedestrians and drivers when they \u201cnegotiate\u201d or \u201ccoordinate\u201d.   What would a study look like that isolates contingency inferences from direct inferences?  Contrast an experiment ran in two conditions: The condition where contingency inferences are not possible The condition where they are possible   He is interested in the density of relations between things and drawing research and analysis boundaries in the places where there is a cluster of dense interconnections connected only sparsely to other things.  How can we extend this idea to: Create a formal ontology Explain how we make object and event distinctions Show that we can derive an optimal conceptual division and ontology for prediction in the world? This would enable us to account for the fact that we reason causally about a continuous and complex world using less continuous and complex models and mechanism It might also provide a direction for creating learning algorithms that learn to predict (environmental) behavior in an intrinsically featureless environment. It might also enable us to show the role of language in structuring thought and in structuring the way in which we individually and jointly break the world into pieces.  Distinctions are used to point to aspects of interest and relevance, not to create a taxonomy for taxonomy\u2019s sake\u2026   How can we do a rigorous analysis of these process.   Historically, we are much better at describing state than process.  Practices are emergent configurations of elements that do a recognizable thing.    \u201cThe sundial is a way of domesticating this wild shadow by giving it a structured surface to project onto.\u201d W.r.t. the Gnomon    \u201cIt won\u2019t be a fish that discovers water.\u201d \u2013(one of Ed Hutchins\u2019 advisers) This is a good quote to illustrate the difficulty of the discovery of things like universal subjective phenomena.  The word culture denotes a complex cognitive ecosystem that \u2026 (ask Ed for the rest of this definition.) Importantly, culture is not just a variable in an experiment, but a complex structured phenomenon that can be broken down into its own components.  Dolphin intelligence should look very different to ours.   The qualitative difference between human culture and animal interactions, is that humans can construct our environments in a manner that makes our interaction more effective.  Damon says that most top tier current philosophers do not do much reading. They just focus on their own work.

V We define negation as your intended equivalence class of state transitions My action in response to your signal does not lie in your intended equivalence class of state transitions, but you realize that it is an accepted or valid state transition [[given the Fregean sense of your signal]].  The Fregean sense of an action i.e. a signal defines an equivalence class of state transitions, but my understanding of the Fregean sense may only be an intended set, the core set, the obvious set of state transitions. And I assume that that is the set that you will perform. If you then do something that is not in that set but I realize that it is in the extension after all, but it wasn\u2019t in the core set, then let us define that as negotiation of the meaning of the signal.    In this world, we now can define goals as (if we have a language for configurations) as pieces on top on of pieces in places.   I am looking for a 2x2 blue square.  We now have a generative language for specifying goals and can run tests against each other to see if we understand each other.   Negotiation ex: I put down the first blue square. I am expecting you to put the piece down in a particular set of places. You do something different, but consistent with my utterance, but not what I expected. Then I realize that it is OK also.  Another term (to decide on term) I say: \u201cthe goal is to build a 2x2x2 cube.\u201d I say \u201cput the blue square beside the blue square. For me, beside is different than on-top. You put it on top. What I realize is that on top is not legal with respect to beside, but it is legal with respect to on-at trajectory to the goal. Has to do with the precedence and importance of subgoals and the global goal.    What we have learned: The notion of cooperation is ambiguous between doing exactly what you say and acting in the spirit of what you say. The spirit is \u201clet\u2019s work together to get to the goal.\u201d The exact thing is doing exactly what I said. Why do I have to do it your way? This is the distinction between strict cooperation and loose cooperation.  We can do this with a block experiment and ethnographic analysis. Clark style.  Blocks on both sides and curtain between them, etc. Try to build the common thing.  Give a list of terms to use as the signals.   Coordination is a process by which multiple agents work together in some way. Although most classical instances of coordination involve a joint goal, this need not be the case. There need only be mutual benefit that can be gained by the interaction thus yielding a motivation for cooperation. In this paper we aim to analyze coordination as a general phenomenon through an abstract formal model. We will first motivate the need for such a theory and model of coordination, and then we will introduce the model in its most basic and paired-down form. We will then iteratively show how the model applies to various coordination scenarios, show how it does not apply to some others, introduce new machinery to generalize it to those new scenarios, show how it applies to those new scenarios and so on until we reach the general form of our model of coordination. We will then demonstrate the model in comparison to its competitors, concluding that we have provided a general theory of coordination that has specific empirical and theoretical bearing on specific instances of coordination from simple games to full communicative scenarios. As our model is a proxy for a theory, we will conclude by integrating our new theory of coordination to other literature on similar subjects showing that we can capture known empirical phenomena and theory in a more unified framework. Need to introduce the work by mentioning the problems with current work on coordination Various properties of the signaling games A shared discrete set of meanings Infeasable models of learning Explicit cues related to understanding without explaining the mechanisms for inference about understandings Unable to capture verification and mind-reading phenomena as well as inference about other minds. We tend to think of meanings as things that can be grasped and therefore are associated with the language (talk to David about the sources), but actually they are things to be shared, to be aligned. This change in concept is essential to grasping broader and more accurate understanding of communication and coordiantion. They are not philosophically accurate or precise (since Lewis, who is outdated in numerous respects) THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING ELSE Coordination is often modeled via classic signaling systems. However effective such models are at capturing a number of important phenomena, there are an equal number that they are fundamentally unable to represent.  The mechanisms of coordination can be captured by a factorization of the causal processes and relations between the agents and the environments into a particular form. Initially, we will constrain the processes we consider and factor them into a particular Markov process. We will then successively generalize various factors until we have a general model of coordination.  [We should be able to prove that a conventional signaling system is fundamentally unable to capture the diversity of processes we observe in human communication. This could involve a parallel between an experiment and a proof. After this, we could introduce a formal model of communication.] [Perhaps I need to briefly discuss my modeling philosophy: that the analytic model should mirror the synthetic phenomena in parallel, and should provide sufficient flexibility to capture the observed phenomena and avoid unmotivated formal and analytic structures that diverge from the empirical.] [Also note that we do not wish to derive formal semantics either current or new, but to derive a more accurate model of how language gets meaning in which we can investigate how specific meanings exist and could have arisen.] The initial model will apply to coordination scenarios where the agents take turns acting on the environment in order to progress towards a joint goal. We do not presently distinguish actions that are on the environment and designed to progress towards the joint goals (pragmatic actions) from those that are designed to enable improved singular or joint understanding or thinking about the situation (epistemic actions) from those that are designed simply to communicate something to the other agent (communicative actions), although there is reason to believe that there are interesting phenomena related to these differences (On Distinguishing Epistemic from Pragmatic Action or something like this). What we do distinguish, however, although we will not yet explore the details of this distinction, is the difference between ephemeral and persistent state properties. Ephemeral state properties are those introduced by the action that are part of the current decision between actions for either agent, but that do not persist in the state by themselves. A clear example of this is a speech act, which may change the state, either internal or external to the agent, but does not itself persist in the environment. Persistent state properties, on the other hand, are those that do continue to exist in the environment. We will consider later how different types of actions either introduce persistent state properties (such as the change in position of a block) or ephemeral state properties (such as the flashing of a light). In addition to the differences between actions and the state changes they induce, we also consider a distinction between the observability of different states. We consider the internal state of an agent to be those properties that affect the causality of the situation (most things) which are observable only to that agent and not to others. The prototypical example of this is the canonical mental state. Similarly, we consider the external state to be that which is observable to all agents. We simplify the situation by not considering properties that are observable to a subset of the agents involved, though there is no reason to believe that the introduction of these properties would significantly affect our conclusions about simple coordination scenarios. This will become a useful distinction because it separates the features of coordination by their epistemic properties and similarly their computational ones. We will find that these epistemic and computational distinction set us up to provide a very general theory of coordination while minimally sacrificing accuracy and that they will naturally enable us to account for known phenomena essential to coordination such as common ground in a principled manner. [Finish explanation of the basic modeling properties before generalization] Assume cooperativity Introduce the causal graph Explain how the causal graph gets extended iteratively into a turn-wise scenario Briefly explain inference mechanisms Briefly mention what will be extended later including internal states, generalization, explicit internal state (or belief) inference, and a less structured model of causality that progresses continuously without requiring explicit turn-taking  [Need to explain where common ground comes in. It is represented here in the internal states of both agents, but this factorization does not do justice to the aboutness property of common ground. Common ground, though it resides in each internal state individually, is actually an inference (for all agents) about the others\u2019 mental states and their inferences about yours, etc. which is derived from prior observations. It will be useful to depict this in a different type of graphical model and to dedicate a section to analyzing the instantiation of common ground as well as how common ground is learned and established. These learning processes are natural products of our contingency-based model of coordination.]  To begin, we will consider the simplest examples of coordination: those where the actions of agents are determined only by the external state (the jointly observable component) and the last action of the other agent.    Need to assume cooperativity, No internal state in a reactive system. In this initial case, the other agent is a purely reactive system, a stimulus-response agent.   I have an intended Markov transition, I want to infer whether you conformed to my intentions.   Initial definition of coordination: Actions are defined as state transitions.  My intentions are defined by an equivalence class of state transitions. Coordination is achieved when your action is contained in my intentions.  The intended contribution of a signal is the set of acceptable state transitions for an agent. The meaning of a signal is the set of state transitions that an agent would deem to be consistent with the signal. We have the same meaning when your equivalence class is the same as my equivalence class.  But we need to take into account negotiation: Acceptable actions with respect to the goal are also defined by an equivalence class of state transitions. Coordination (or cooperation) with me is achieved when your action is contained in my set of acceptable actions. Negotiation occurs when your action is initially outside of my intentions, but is within my set of acceptable actions.  [Is there any reason to have this initial intentions and negotiation in general model? Are they simply mechanisms by which we reduce the complexity of the computation by separating the prediction and verification mechanisms?] [Introduce the notion of a coordinating structure. This is what you coordinate on. It should be introduced in a sufficiently general way such that it captures the simple structures used initially, but makes room for more abstract structures.] An additional and important consideration, especially for later extensions of our model of coordination, is the notion of a coordinating structure. A coordinating structure is what the agents coordinate on. A coordinating structure determines the set of acceptable actions for each agent in the coordination scenario. The set of acceptable actions may or may not be the same for each party, but each agent must agree upon the set of acceptable actions for the other agents including himself. Such a structure must be mutually agreed upon implicitly, as the set of actions you perform must align with the set of actions I find it acceptable for you to perform and vice versa. In the simplest case, the coordination structure is simply the set of sets of acceptable actions for each agent applied to the other agents. [Should graphically illustrate this], but in more complex cases, the coordinating structure can determine these sets of acceptable actions in another way. The coordinating structure captures the essence of the coordination scenario and coordination is achieved if and only if the each agent\u2019s actions are in accord with those specified by the coordinating structure throughout the coordination scenario. (Maybe note the similarity to Clark\u2019s notion of common ground and how this will help us to capture common ground and how it is established later in a principled formal manner.)  Furthermore: To understand a signal is to intend to perform an action or action sequence that is within the other agent\u2019s intention set for that signal. Understanding a signal and performing this intended action successfully is therefore to successfully coordinate.   A simple example of non-coordination occurs when, given the mutual goal that we want to build a tower of blocks, I say, \u201cput the blue block on the ground.\u201d There are multiple blue blocks of different sizes so you put the small blue block on the ground. However, I know that a tower needs to be started with the largest block and therefore I intended the largest blue block as the referent of my expression. Your action is consistent with my utterance meaning, but is not in line with my intended contribution, nor does it result in coordination as it is outside my intention set.  However, let us instead imagine that, equal in size to the largest blue block is a red block. In response to my utterance, \u201cput the blue block on the ground,\u201d you put the largest red block on the ground. Though this is inconsistent with the meaning of the utterance, it is within my set of acceptable state transitions, because all I care about is the fact that the largest block gets put on the ground. This is an example of negotiation.  But the inference about coordination success can progress gradually. Let us instead imagine that I tell you \u201cbuild a tower of blocks alternating between red and blue,\u201d and that all of the blocks are the same size. You begin by placing a blue block on the ground. At this point you appear to in coordination, although I gain very little inference about whether you are in coordination, as your only initial action that could have been inconsistent with this utterance would be to abstain from placing any blocks at all. You then put a second red block on top of the first. You still appear to be in coordination, and now I am more likely to believe that you understood my utterance. You then put a blue block on top and my inferred probability of understanding continues to rise. This is because it is increasingly unlikely, as you continue to perform actions consistent with my intentions, that your conforming to my intentions is a suspicious coincidence. It becomes increasingly likely that it is due to understanding my signal. If you complete the tower with a fourth red block, then you have successfully coordinated with me. If instead, you complete the tower with a fourth blue block, then, despite my earlier predictions, you have failed to conform.   We will see later, both theoretically and empirically, that we interpret utterances, not on their form alone, but on the contingency between the utterance and the state, and more precisely, between the utterances and various important properties of the state such as common ground, beliefs, desires, inferences about the beliefs of the other agent, goals, and more. Though this is equivalent in a mathematical sense to saying that an utterance is interpreted in terms of the context, factoring this relationship into contingencies yields a much clearer picture of the role of the context and on how to incorporate contextual inference into both theoretical and practical coordination and communication systems.   [Discuss the factorization of the contingencies and causation.]   [The action is an ephemeral state property, and the external state is a set of persistent state properties. Any information or interaction caused by ephemeral state properties only have effects beyond the current time step if they are incorporated into the persistent components of the state.]  In addition to these highly simplified experimental tasks, we can also show that this framework applies very naturally to a variety of real-world communication and coordination scenarios. [Discuss the examples (chess, Chipotle, etc.) from the frame of this formal model] [Sheep herding as coordination?]  [Do this with Blackjack and a set of alternative point goals. \u201cIn their country, in each casino people play blackjack to a different number.\u201d] We can demonstrate the wide applicability of even this extremely simplified model of coordination by applying it to a set of scenarios. The first scenario is a chess game between two players. Where a Lewis-style model of coordination was applied only to Von Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s games of pure coordination, we can apply ours to a wider range of more adversarial games such as chess (though it may be possible to do the same with theirs). The key to this lies in the realization that players in a game of chess must still hold to our assumption about cooperativity, which in this case is with respect to the rules of the game. When coordinating in a game such as chess, the coordination is not at the level of the pay-offs of the individual moves, but in playing by the rules. When I make a move, I do not make an arbitrary one, but only those that I believe are deemed legal by the mutually and implicitly agreed upon set of rules defined by chess.  We model chess similarly to how we modeled the example of telling someone to build a tower. By beginning the game, each player begins with a set of acceptable actions that the other player is to follow. It just so happens that this set of acceptable actions is often the same for both players and that for each player, the set of acceptable actions they impose on the other player is the same as the set that they impose on themselves. This is not a necessary feature of the model, but a property of the game of chess and of a larger class of coordination scenarios where the set of rules one imposes on one\u2019s own actions is the same as the set that they expect the other agent to follow. Due to the structure of chess, this property is essential to keep the game fair. What is different about chess from the block stacking game is that the set of acceptable actions changes at each move. Just like in our more general model, this set is dependent on the external state of the world. However, the set of acceptable actions is defined on a higher level coordinating structure, namely the set of rules of the game. Though, throughout the game, we always expect the other agent to play by the rules, the rules impose a different set of acceptable actions on different states of the game (in chess the game state is almost entirely captured by the state of the board, but not entirely due to castling and en passant). This property of an abstract coordinating structure is but a simple extension to the more basic coordination problem. In the case of an abstract coordinating structure, the set of acceptable actions is simply specified by the abstraction coordinated upon instead of directly. We can work through an example of a chess game to better illustrate this principle. We will take the perspective of a player A, whose opponent is player B. Though we only take one perspective in this game, it is worth noting that the other perspective plays out in exactly the same way, simply with respect to his own set of intentions and acceptable actions.  [Play out the chess game to illustrate the abstract coordination structure. Additionally, it may be helpful to do a Bayesian analysis of this to capture the agent\u2019s calculated probability of coordination upon a set of rules. It may also be useful to go through how an agent might learn about the transition probabilities in this simple model to make it easier to later add a more complex one.] \u2026 [This next section is on modeling with a Bayesian approach] Because of the higher-order coordination structure involved in chess (namely, the rules), a simple observation of the contingencies between states and actions is not sufficient to confirm coordination. This is because the coordination structures and therefore the coordination scenarios do not persist for a single action like in the first block stacking example, but for a series of actions in an extended coordination scenario. Because of this extension into multi-turn coordination scenarios, coordination must be inferred by observing whether agents continue to act within the set of acceptable actions as determined by the coordination structure. In the case of chess, this is equivalent to the observation of whether your opponent continues to act within your understanding of the rules.  Instead of simply observing whether the other agent\u2019s actions were so far consistent with the coordinating structure, we might want to infer the likelihood that they are operating in accordance with the coordinating structure. This is equivalent to inferring the probability that the other agent is in coordination with you: often an important inference to make. In order to do this, we can take a classical Bayesian approach, which fits the scenario quite nicely and is equivalent to an information-theoretic approach that we will not illustrate (I think it is equivalent).  We can begin by imagining the set of acceptable actions as a hypothesis about the rule guiding the behavior of the other agent. If it is indeed the case that the other agent is in coordination with me, his actions will be governed by the set of acceptable actions determined by the coordination structure. [The other agent\u2019s choice of action with respect to the coordination structure is not uniform in the set of acceptable actions, but guided by other goals. These goals need to be taken into account when doing inference. Because of this, I may wish to introduce this Bayesian framework first with respect to the block stacking scenario and then later extend it to take into account this joint inference between coordination and goal.] [For the joint inference between goal and coordination: Given a constraint and a goal, we have a probability distribution over actions. Given an action, we have a probability distribution over a constraint and a goal? Given a set of actions, we can do joint inference? It is possible that the action of the agent would have been optimal for a variety of constraints given a goal, but it is also possible that it would not. It is possible that the action of an agent would be optimal for a variety of goals given a constraint, but it is also possible that it would not.] [Go through the Bayesian approach including the alternate hypotheses, the size principle, the prior probabilities, etc.]    [Discuss the Chipotle game and coordinating on a set of ordering procedures. This game involves an expectation set and a set of acceptable actions as well as an asymmetry between the two players that illustrates asymmetric coordination structures. It also provides an opportunity to further emphasize the importance of contingencies.] [Discuss cases where the coordination structures are exchangeable] [Discuss cases where the coordination structures are not exchangeable, but are exchangeable with respect to the observed data] [Discuss how this becomes unlikely when there is complex cross-checking and interdependency] [Philosophically discuss how the cases that are not dissociable and are exchangeable correspond to inference about phenomenological properties such as color phenomena.]  Why this model is not general and generalizing the model by introducing the notion of generalization (and the hidden state) Though the scenarios so far have been captured in large part by our simplified model of coordination, there is a large class of scenarios that are more complicated and cannot be captured in this way. Moreover, the set of scenarios so far were also analyzable with respect to the classical and generally-accepted model of coordination introduced by David Lewis\u2019 Convention. We will show that the ones that follow are not and that only our model can be extended in a simple and natural way to capture the unsofarcaptured aspects.  A simple scenario that defies prediction by our model involves that of a patient in a doctor\u2019s office.   [Need to show later how the state machine model of an agent can be factored into a simple MDP for an agent (I think mostly) and how the addition of an interior state generalizes it to a POMDP (Again I think mostly).] [Potentially add a note about the perspectives imposed by such a model and how each model captures the perspective of an agent who is a part of a larger system.]    [How are coordination structures set up? They are set up through communication in the same way that they are verified. Go through a set of examples and work through this duality of set-up and use of coordination structures and show how it enables a fluid process by which we can communicate and coordinate. Talk about this process in a discourse and with language. This setting up of coordination structures enables the communication and constant verification of coordination structures. ] [An utterance sets up a coordination structure by imposing a set of expected and acceptable responses on the other person. These expectations lie solely in the mind of the utterer or first party. The other person then responds to the utterance according to their interpretation of its meaning. This interpretation lies entirely within the second party. If the response is within the set of acceptable actions set by the first party, then an instance of coordination has occurred. If all the responses that the second party considered appropriate (and may have performed counterfactually) are in the set of acceptable responses of the first party and if the entire set of acceptable responses of the first party is contained within the set of actions the second party considered appropriate, then there is perfect conceptual alignment between the first party and the second party with respect to the meaning of the utterance of the first party.] Perhaps move this to the beginning: [Inferring the coordination of the other party is closely related to asking \u201cdid they understand me?\u201d To infer this understanding, there are a number of things that must be taken into account. First is: What do you expect them do understand and what do you expect them to do given this understanding? Are these expectations for a single action? Or for a longer period of time? While they are acting, it is most important to ask: Is what they are doing consistent with an understanding of what I said or attempted to communicate? If so, you can ask: How much evidence does their action give about whether they understand or not? The strength of this evidence is dependent on a number of factors including their goals, the size of the set of the possible actions, the size of the set of consistent actions, and the probabilities of each of the actions independent of the context and goals and given the context and goals, but the key thing to compute is the probability that they would have committed that action given that they did not understand you. If you can compute this, then it is simple to infer whether they did understand you. Of course, if they commit a series of actions, then this evidence accumulates. This can all be elegantly captured using Bayesian probability.]  [We can also use the dual nature of actions in setting up coordination structures and in assessing coordination to argue that the model captures a smooth transition between language acquisition and language use not present in traditional formal accounts. It accounts for phenomena such as discourse alignment and intraconversational allusion where people learn and agree upon usages of words on the fly in a discourse. This is a phenomenon not presently captured in any formal account of communication.]  [How does this relate to theory of mind? Perhaps discuss the with the doctor patient example?]  [What about the case where you do not believe someone that they understand you? Simply ask them to extrapolate beyond what you gave them. If they provide a detailed extrapolation that is a priori unlikely to be generated (not generally applicable) that is consistent with your understanding, then it is extremely unlikely that they generated this without understanding you. This is how we verify understanding, at least in a highly explicit manner.]  [I aim to provide a synchronic account of communication in general.] [How can we form this model into an NLP framework?]  [We want to subsume and clarify and/or to contradict and give evidence for our version.]

V Notes from meeting with David:  Focus on examples of contingency checking about other people: Chess Tennis Joint cooking Turing test Ordering at Chipotle Conversation Counterexample (in a sense): videogames where the structure of the environment is set up such that it is impossible to not coordinate and cooperate in many ways because the environment will not allow it.   \u000aRead the Turing Test paper   Three types of responses: There are things that are expected There are things that are not expected, but are consistent There are things that are inconsistent  Ex: when cooking, if I ask you to beat the eggs, you could: Crack the eggs in the bowl and beat them (expected) Crack the eggs in the bowl and go to the restroom, and I will beat them instead (not expected, but consistent) Crack the eggs in a frying pan and cook them over easy. (inconsistent) The same is true with other cases such as language.  We can explore these examples using contingency tables and similar discrete structures whilst keeping open the idea that there people do not have discrete decision lists, but models of the world in which they more continuously predict and model consistent actions.  Such models enable us to establish conceptual alignment as well as to establish coordination in a broader sense. They also relate to modeling an understanding of the non-agentic external world.  What are the differences between modeling the non-agentic external world and the agentic external world? What is added to coordinating actions in order to reason about the internal representations of another? Does it require inference about similarity with respect to the relations between the external actions and the internal states and causes behind the actions? Does it require generalization across instances and uses of the concepts?  Language is almost always learned in context. How do we learn to separate the components of the language into componential meanings? Meanings clearly do not lie in the word or even in the expression, but in the context and the expression system. The words do not have explicit and discrete meanings, but they play roles in the generation of meanings. An important question in language learning is how do we learn to assign credit to the components of the meaning such that they can be used in novel scenarios with predictable effects? Is there a version of cross-situational language learning that can model how this works and how meaning components become associated with words and with sentences and with expressions and with different size structures in general?  When you learn word meanings, you learn them from another person.   How do we learn what the word \u201cthoroughly\u201d means?  Explore these contingency relations in these circumscribed areas and then later apply it to language.  Investigate \u201crepairs\u201d to coordination.  Read some of the scripts literature to make sure that I am not repeating their mistakes.  Moves in the game: \u201ccompensate\u201d \u201cnegotiate\u201d \u201crepair\u201d \u201cpower\u201d \u201cdominance\u201d \u201cstalemate\u201d \u201cdropping out\u201d \u201cquestions\u201d \u201cignoring\u201d \u201cdenial\u201d  He says: \u201cmaybe you want a taxonomy of questions\u201d   A big prior is that the people want to cooperate Giving the benefit of the doubt is also a strategy often employed. Helps the appearance of coordination, may hurt coordination.  Develop a concept of \u201cmargin of error.\u201d How far can they be off whilst the system continues to work. How far can the alignment be off and the system still work?

V Notes from meeting with David:  Focus on examples of contingency checking about other people: Tennis Joint cooking Turing test Ordering at Chipotle   \u000aRead the Turing Test paper   Three types of responses: There are things that are expected There are things that are not expected, but are consistent There are things that are inconsistent  Ex: when cooking, if I ask you to beat the eggs, you could: Crack the eggs in the bowl and beat them (expected) Crack the eggs in the bowl and go to the restroom, and I will beat them instead (not expected, but consistent) Crack the eggs in a frying pan and cook them over easy. (inconsistent) The same is true with other cases such as language.  We can explore these examples using contingency tables and similar discrete structures whilst keeping open the idea that there people do not have discrete decision lists, but models of the world in which they more continuously predict and model consistent actions.  Such models enable us to establish conceptual alignment as well as to establish coordination in a broader sense. They also relate to modeling an understanding of the non-agentic external world.  What are the differences between modeling the non-agentic external world and the agentic external world? What is added to coordinating actions in order to reason about the internal representations of another? Does it require inference about similarity with respect to the relations between the external actions and the internal states and causes behind the actions? Does it require generalization across instances and uses of the concepts?  Language is almost always learned in context. How do we learn to separate the components of the language into componential meanings? Meanings clearly do not lie in the word or even in the expression, but in the context and the expression system. The words do not have explicit and discrete meanings, but they play roles in the generation of meanings. An important question in language learning is how do we learn to assign credit to the components of the meaning such that they can be used in novel scenarios with predictable effects? Is there a version of cross-situational language learning that can model how this works and how meaning components become associated with words and with sentences and with expressions and with different size structures in general?  When you learn word meanings, you learn them from another person.   How do we learn what the word \u201cthoroughly\u201d means?  Explore these contingency relations in these circumscribed areas and then later apply it to language.  Investigate \u201crepairs\u201d to coordination.  Read some of the scripts literature to make sure that I am not repeating their mistakes.  Moves in the game: \u201ccompensate\u201d \u201cnegotiate\u201d \u201crepair\u201d \u201cpower\u201d \u201cdominance\u201d \u201cstalemate\u201d \u201cdropping out\u201d \u201cquestions\u201d \u201cignoring\u201d \u201cdenial\u201d  He says: \u201cmaybe you want a taxonomy of questions\u201d   A big prior is that the people want to cooperate Giving the benefit of the doubt is also a strategy often employed. Helps the appearance of coordination, may hurt coordination.  Develop a concept of \u201cmargin of error.\u201d How far can they be off whilst the system continues to work. How far can the alignment be off and the system still work?

V She starts: Meaning not in the message. Meaning in an interaction between lots of factors including concepts and context.  \u201cPhilosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\u201d \u2013Wittgenstein  Reddy 1979 talks about the conduit metaphor vs. an information theoretic analysis of language.  \u201cMeaning is intrinsic if intelligence is natural\u201d \u2013Hofstadter.  Meaning is in the interaction of the decoding function and the text.  Information measures the ability to select a relevant event from a set of alternatives.  Communication is the transfer of this ability to select between alternatives in this framework.  There needs to be an a priori shared context and set of shared alternatives. She claims and they claim. However, I claim that we do not have this.    The concepts are not in the signal. Information confers power o make selections among concepts, not the concepts themselves. Communication depends on the extent to which \u2026 It requires alignment between concept structures.  Communication is a predictive and probabilistic process.  We can quantify information by the amount of uncertainty about the referent or meaning reduced by the signal.  Peaks in entropy are strongly correlated with difficulties in comprehension\u2026  She has interest in nouns.   The question I am asking is: in an information theoretic model of language, how do we know that the alternatives or the maps are the same? What happens if our conceptual gerrymandering varies between people? What forces push these gerrymandering schemes into conceptual alignment?  Entropy is lowered by gender information.  Semantically similar nouns tend to take different genders for high frequency nouns. The reverse for low frequency nouns.

V Here we will explore the traditional model of communication, and a simple generalization of it. We will then see what is required of the listener in order to communicate in such a model and we will explore how these requirements may be met using inference about the speaker through contingency observations. Perhaps using this I will be able to build a PAC model of communication.  Section 2: Formalization The success of a listener\u2019s action   is given bywhere  iff  and otherwise. This describes a coordination scenario where the success of a listener\u2019s action is dependent on the accuracy of his knowledge of some part of the speaker\u2019s beliefs.  is a partial state of the speaker\u2019s beliefs or internal state. is as inferred by the listener.  is a message.  describes how the speaker\u2019s beliefs are translated into a message.  describes for the listener\u2019s beliefs about the speaker\u2019s beliefs are extracted from a message.  We can see that  iff X\u2019=X iff  which holds for all x in X iff    We define ideal communication as communication where X\u2019=X always holds. We have shown that ideal communication is only guaranteed in the case that . That is, it is only guaranteed when the speaker\u2019s translation function of a belief to a message is the inverse of the listener\u2019s translation function from a message to a belief.   The information theoretic model of communication makes this assumption.  We can further loosen these requirements if we wish communication to be successful is the listener\u2019s action dependent on the speaker\u2019s beliefs is successful and if we claim that this action is successful if the listener\u2019s belief about the speaker\u2019s belief is within a certain \u201cdistance\u201d of the speaker\u2019s actual belief.  To accommodate this new scenario, we redefine  such that  iff  and otherwise.  will be known as the precision requirement and may vary from action to action.  If we use this imprecision model, then our success criteria for communication change. Instead of requiring that , we now only require that, ,  . We can see that the requirements do not lie in the listener\u2019s of the speaker\u2019s translation functions alone, but in their composition. We will quantify this error as, which will be known as the alignment with respect to. We will also quantify the total alignment between the listener and the speaker as.  Similarly, we can define the accuracy with respect to  as and the total accuracy between the speaker and the listener as . If the accuracy is less than 1, then the communication is successful. (Note that this does not hold for the total accuracy. If the communication is successful, then the total accuracy must be less than |X|, but the converse does not hold.)   We have seen that coordination or communication (as we have defined them) are successful if and only if the alignment between the speaker and the listener is less than the precision requirement for each relevant speaker belief. As a listener, how can I be sure that my beliefs about the speaker\u2019s beliefs are accurate? In the information theoretic model, this question does not come up, since we know that the listener and the speaker\u2019s translation functions are symmetric. But what happens when, like we do in natural situations, do not have this guarantee? We can view this problem as a problem of the listener making inferences about the alignment. Prima facie, there are a couple of ways this might occur: We could assume that the speaker is similar to the listener and therefore that the alignment will be within tolerance We could try to make other inferences about the speaker\u2019s beliefs We could try to make inferences about the speaker\u2019s translation function Let us briefly explore the consequences of each of these possible strategies.    3: In order to make inferences about the nature of S, the listener might observe some contingencies between what the speaker says and what the state of the world is. We can capture these contingencies as M=C(state) which stands for the contingency between the observable state of the world and the message produced by S. We assume for the purposes of the model that M=C(state) is a fixed probability distribution. Though contingencies are generated deterministically, the variables that determine their generation are not all visible to the listener and therefore the contingency function (which captures the listener\u2019s observations), is probabilistic. So far these contingencies do not capture the speaker\u2019s translation function, because they do not capture the belief state of the speaker. Contingencies are learned through observation, and, as we will explore later, generalization. What happens if we posit a function x=B(world state, internal state, speaker) that determines the belief state of the speaker based on the state of the world and the prior internal state of the speaker? We can model this in full, but for now, let us simplify the model and claim that the beliefs of the speaker are dependent solely on the state of the world. In this case, x=B(world state, speaker). Even with this, the listener does not have access either to S or to x. However, the listener does know M=C(state) and since x=B(world state, speaker) is fully determined by the observable components of the state in this case, the contingency becomes a deterministic function. The listener can now perform an inference on S based on: M=S(x) M=C(state) S(x)=C(state) S(B(state))=C(state) L(S(B(state))=L(C(state))  state=C-1(M) x=B(C-1(M)) B-1(x)=C-1(M)  However, this is still not a sufficient amount of information for the listener to infer x. [Need to prove this. Would be interesting.] There is no way for the listener to infer x from the state of the world and the message.  Instead, let us temporarily change the problem from a communication problem to a coordination problem. Now the listener is not interested in x, but in AS(x), which is the speaker\u2019s action based on their belief state x. [argue for why this is sufficient.] Now we can show that the speaker and the listener can coordinate effectively.  Because AS is observable to the listener, the listener can observe contingencies of the form: AS=C(state). Using these observations, the listener can coordinate with the speaker simply by observing the state and calculating the speaker\u2019s action for state-action contingencies that have already been observed.  However, there are still some difficulties. First, since world-states are highly complex, the exact state-action contingency is not likely to have been observed before by the listener. In the current model, without this prior experience with the contingency, the listener cannot predict the speaker\u2019s action and therefore cannot coordinate. Second, the speaker\u2019s action does not depend only on the jointly observable state of the world, but also on the hidden state of the speaker\u2019s mental faculties. In this case, AS=C(state) is not a deterministic relation, but a probabilistic approximation to AS=BS(world state, mental state). Moreover, it is not clear yet how the probabilistic approximation would be constructed by the listener.  We will see that both of these difficulties can be accounted for by some degree by the listener and we will use the next section to explore how. We begin with the first difficulty.  The first difficulty essentially amounts to a problem of generalization. Without a means of generalizing beyond what has been observed, the listener has no means by which to predict the speaker\u2019s outcome in states that are not exactly the same as those that have been previously encountered. Generalization, however, is not simple to do correctly. There are infinite ways to generalize beyond a given set of data and no one way is objectively more right than any of the others. In the case of communication, however, we can come up with ways by which to produce effective generalizations. This is because we have additional knowledge about the party we are communicating with.

V The Question at Hand: How do we coordinate with and make inferences about the contents of other minds given that they are opaque to direct inquiry? What processes and activities depend on inferring the contexts of other minds, and how do they relate? How can we create a formal theory that describes these processes? In general: how do we communicate and coordinate given that we do not have direct access to the contents of others\u2019 beliefs?  We learn language through contingencies. We use language based on contingencies. Contingencies enable fluid and deep inference about the interlocutor at all points in a discourse, which is something that is not possible from an information-theoretic perspective. More generally, contingency relations enable fluid and deep inference about the mental states, goals, and probable behavior of a partner at all points in a coordination game.   Lots of current literature in linguistics and cognitive science points to the heavy context dependence of concepts and categories and word meanings. Classical models of human communication do not handle this so well for a variety of reasons (explain this). The purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework for the analysis of communication that captures our modern understanding of how humans communicate in a precise formal manner.

V Patricia Churchland Talk  I claim: that there is an evolutionary argument for altruism, which is due to the similarity of genes of those who are close to you and therefore that altruism to familial members propagates your genes as well.  Organized religion began 10000 years ago.  She is 3.9% Neanderthal  Fuzzy categories are in some way relevant\u2026 (she says this is analogous to the social domain of norms)  She is arguing that the development of learning requires birth at a more tablula-rasa state where adaptation to the environment at the organism level requires a relative helplessness at birth. The propagation of this helplessness requires care of offspring and therefore is a basis for altruism. Therefore \u201csociality is a basic value for warm-blooded mammals\u201d And that this is due to the cooption of Oxytocin as some modulator of sociality.  Basal Ganglia are related to reinforcement learning.   Maybe we don\u2019t need a gene for cooperation, but it emerges naturally in a social condition of trust?  Larry: Norms facilitate generalization of behavior, allowing us to avoid difficult derivations  Many norms are implicit  The development of norms reflect the structure of the environment.  Social interactional norms are called morals by her.  Other places have much different norms. Ex: in some places deception is worse than murder because it lasts longer.  A general philosophical ethics is therefore unrealistic, as the conditions under which morals develop are flexible.  Perhaps this simply means that our theory of ethics should be abstracted one level away from specifics and instead be a theory of the development of ethics, which I suppose is what she is presenting here.  Question: Perhaps in a bit less controversial or strong a manner, you argue that a general philosophical theory of ethics is untenable due to the variation of ethics based on cultural and biological ecological context. I tend to agree, though I might be a little biased because I have never had much stake in normative ethics. Do you think that this means that philosophers should derive a theory of ethics abstracted one level away from specifics and as a theory of the development of ethics? I would argue that this is essentially what you are presenting here.   She agrees with my view on Kahneman\u2019s work that real human reason is embodied in the interactions of culture and biology and environment, and not based on normative formal systems.   She claims that Hamilton was wrong and that the behavioral ethologists would agree with this. There is an equation of this. Perhaps true for lower-level animals.  There is also an important cultural evolutionary level.  She argues that religion is a way of controlling behavior in lieu of people being around to respond to you. There are \u201cunseen eyes\u201d that are always watching you.    Philip Kitcher\u2019s The Ethical Project \u201cis the best book on ethics to come out in 50 years\u201d  During lunch, Patricia thought my work sounded really interesting!

V Paul Bays Job Talk There is an idea that neural noise sets limits on our performance in many tasks But what about discriminating computation from noise? Spike time reliability\u2026 And what about the power that comes from robustness in the face of noise? He is interested in the idea that neural noise may limit working memory In contrast to an antiquated \u201cslot\u201d model\u2026 or a fixed capacity buffer Uses a visual discrimination task Has a paper in science Wants us to think of memory as a resource Derives his model from underlying population coding models Claims that the instantaneous probability of a neuron firing at a given time is set by the mean firing rate. (simple Poisson noise assumption.) Seung and Sompolinsky PNAS 1993 ; Zemel, Dayan, and Pouget Neural Computation 1998   Can we use the computational noise model to propose a memory resource that works analogously to information theoretic channel capacity? This seems highly plausible in a Hopfield-Style model of distributed associative memory\u2026  Incorporating information is optimally done by weighting the sources by the inverse of their variance  Is this related to Kalman filtering?  Seems to make intuitive sense  Wants to explain judgement confidence, latency, and decay rate and why they vary with memory load  What is the neural basis for binding features together into objects in WM? Can we predict errors of misbinding?  How does noise affect higher-order representations in vision such as shapes and letters?  How does noise in working memory affect decision making?  What other information does WM carry forward acros eye movements? E.g. gaze history, information about salience and reward?   Could you also account for this kind of effect as coming from noise in the encoding process and this creating something analogous to a channel capacity in a noisy recurrent network model such as a Boltzmann machine?  Nitz wonders where the uncertainty is actually represented since we can act in a manner dependent on the reliability.

V Philosophy is the discipline in which everything is questioned. With this sole definition, we might note that progress cannot be made without first making assumptions, or instead proposing definitions. Though these assumptions and definitions may be questioned under later evidence, it is essential that there be some grounds under which they may be shown to fail. The most natural of these grounds seems to be logical consistency. If that which follows from the definitions of a system of reasoning does not exhibit internal consistency, then we can say that either that which has been shown to follow has indeed been argued incorrectly or that the initial definitions and suppositions were in fact unreasonable. If we question our very system of logical inference from perspectives that have been drawn from this very system, then we are creating a circular argument which by some most basic such axioms, cannot serve any function. Philosophy therefore, despite its questioning nature, requires some universal grounds. Though these grounds may be questioned later due to problems found through inconsistent inference, it appears to be impossible to make any inference at all without this form of guessing and checking. Therefore a rational philosophy where logic is taken as universal and unquestionable must take a form where a set of grounds is proposed, the consequences of these grounds are inferred, some internal inconsistency is found, and then the set of grounds is amended in an attempt to eliminate this inconsistency, and the inference is attempted once more. It is by this method that we may find knowledge in a straightforward manner, as many other methods seem plagued by the possibility for circularity without recognizing it. If we are to try to internally amend an argument or to question the very structure of either logic or grounds within an ontology derived from this logic and these grounds, then circularity ensues and failure is inevitable.

V Larry Muhlstein March 1st 2015  Rough Wittgensteinian Outline of Communication and Causality  Shannon\u2019s communication theory requires that the meanings of signals be known a priori It treats only the transmission of signals. Computers and telecommunications equipment do know the \u201cmeanings\u201d of their signals a priori. This is built into their workings. Computers and telecommunications equipment do not need to learn the meanings of their signals. The signals being the information transmitted, not how this information relates to meaning in the person. This was irrelevant to Shannon, as he was only concerned with transmitting information without loss But the meanings of signals are not known to people a priori. They cannot be known a priori because they vary between languages and even between people. They are therefore synthetic and a posteriori and must be learned from experience. Of course we have natural propensities to learn language and to learn languages and meanings of certain kinds more readily than those of others. However, the exact nature of the trade-off between nativism and empiricism does not matter here. What matters is only that we need to learn the meanings of words. The few points related to the degree to which we require native properties to learn language that matter to our argument are detailed later. Roughly, it is the case that we need to have some sort of bias towards learning some possible languages rather than others and we need to approximately share these biases between our communication partners.  And we observe that they are indeed learned from exposure to the world. It is relatively clear how these meanings might be learned in the cases where the meanings and the signals are observed to co-occur. Though the specifics are not necessarily clear, we know that people can, at the most basic level, observe correlations between when a word is used and the state of the world at that moment The indeterminacy problem remains, but it is lightened a bit because many situations do not require a precise meaning for a word, but only an approximate meaning, which is often available. Furthermore, cross-situational experience with these words increases the specificity of their meanings We have many models to account for how this process works, and though it is much more complicated than we have shown, we will leave the issue to rest because it does not bear on the argument at hand. It is not so clear, however, how these meanings are learned when the meaning is not observable, but the signal is. There needs to be something to pair to the signal, otherwise there is no way to differentiate between possible meanings. So if this component of the meaning is not directly observable, it must be indirectly inferable. I contend that these meanings are learned through a process of causal inference This process at its simplest level is similar to the process given by Alva No\u2019s sensorimotor contingency theory It is learned by observing the relations between what is said and what is done, of course given the state of the environment and other things inferable about the mental state of the partner. In general, we can use observed relations or contingencies between what we do and what we observe to learn about how the world works in a causal manner. We know this from epistemological theories, learning theories, sensorimotor contingency theory, and others. Moreover, it is obvious. We can use observed relations or contingencies between what we say and how our partner reacts to learn about how they understand our utterances in a causal manner. This is because learning in general is such an epistemic process and learning signals and language are but special cases of this general process. The causal learning processes and models that we use, however, may be very broad, and this theory does not have bearing on the specific ones. I only claim that that these processes should be consistent with a general theory of causal learning as proposed by various people including, most notably, Judea Pearl They need to be consistent because the world works in a causal way, and because the only way to predict something in a causally-governed world is by mirroring the causal structure of that world in your learning and generalization process. It is not lost on the author that the nature of this causality may be contingent and that causality may be defined only by the mechanisms we can use to predict it. In this way, though the world has a certain kind causal structure, this structure is captured only by models that capture the structure of this causality, whatever it might be. This mirroring and capturing of causality to enable prediction is how science as a whole functions. This is most apparent in physics, but exists for all sciences that attempt to predict. Since we need our understandings of signal and language meaning to generalize beyond the current situation, at least to some degree, we need to capture the causal structure of the meaning space in our model. If we need to learn such a model because the meaning space is not predetermined, then we must have faculties that enable us to learn in a causal way. We can choose these utterances to probe the detailed ways in which others understand language Though this relates to the world only when such utterances are grounded\u2014when they are related to utterances about observable things We need to probe the detailed ways in which others learn language because everyone speaks at least a slightly different language. This is because everyone learns from different experiences and everyone\u2019s generalization processes are at least a little different. Therefore, when communicating with people, we must learn to speak their language as they learn to speak ours. That is, we must coordinate on a language that is to be used between us.  We observe this type of coordination to be highly prevalent if not omnipresent in discourse. See the work of Simon Garrod and Martin Pickering for more details. Another reason that it must be the case that we probe the languages of others is because we have the ability to recognize conflicts between our understandings of signals, words, and utterances and those of others. Without some way to probe the meanings that others associate with their signals and utterances, we would have no way of detecting this conflict. Each of our utterances would constitute a semantic ship, all of which would pass undetected in the darkness of dead reckoning. We can also choose these utterances to communicate things Utterances are understood in terms of the effects they have on the state of the discourse. This is of course within the current discourse. This is the \u201cworking meaning\u201d of the utterance. Just like Wittgenstein\u2019s \u201cSlab!\u201d meant to hand over a slab, the meanings of other utterances are determined by what they do, internally or externally to the state. Of course this is modulated by the context and the manner of utterance in a particular way. This mirrors the enactive view that actions are understood in terms of their perceivable effects, but extends this to be that actions are understood in terms of the effects that can be inferred by the perceivable effects. This is equivalent to adding unobservable variables between the action and the perception in a causal graph. This predicts that utterances will have different meanings in different discourses, as they have different effects in different discourse states. We observe this to be the case. We can further describe this in terms of the goals of the utterance and of the discourse. Different utterances are produced and different meanings are interpreted depending on how they interface with goals. If we are out in the desert and we are burning and you utter \u201clet\u2019s find some shade,\u201d \u201cshade\u201d might be satisfied by a building because the goal is simply to get out of the sun. If we are in the park enjoying the weather and want to read a computer screen and the same utterance is produced, then \u201cshade\u201d might not include an indoor environment, but only a covering from the sun. This is achieved due to equivalence classes of meaning derived from the goals. The goal of preventing skin from burning is achieved by any means of getting out of the sun, but the goal of enjoying the weather and reading a computer screen is achieved only by finding an outdoor cover. The interpretation of the utterance \u201clet\u2019s find some shade\u201d is dependent on the equivalence class of states that achieve the goal at hand. This is consistent with the idea of ad-hoc concepts. The concept of shade is dependent on the goals and the context. The component of an utterance\u2019s purpose that is designed to tell us about the way our interlocutor uses language can be seen as the exploration component The component of an utterance\u2019s purpose that is designed to communicate something and therefore to move directly towards a goal can be seen as the utterance\u2019s exploitation component Another way to look at this involves the distinction between pragmatic and epistemic actions The exploration component is the epistemic action component The exploitation component is the pragmatic action component We propose that speakers choose utterances primarily based on these two components Of course this choice is informed by the structure and nature of their goals, the confidence of their beliefs about the ways in which their interlocutors use language, the sensitivity of the goals to the language, and the importance of getting everything right When making these inferences, we also bring other abstract knowledge to bear on the problem This knowledge includes anything that would give us an expectation as to how the partner is likely to use language and is likely to hold meaning including knowledge about their language community, their cultural affiliations, and more. Such knowledge can also be jointly inferred with the meaning of their language, as certain usages are likely to point towards language communities and regularities, and such regularities are likely to influence the interpretation of their language.  We also make use of knowledge about their similarity to us in order to bias what we think they are likely to mean by a phrase (as they are likely to mean what we mean if they are similar to us, and in order to bias how they are likely to generalize concepts A key problem in language learning and learning in general is that there exist an infinite number of ways to generalize beyond observed data with none of these ways privileged over any other in an absolute sense. In order to learn and generalize, we must have inductive biases that cause us to favor certain types of generalizations over others. If everyone\u2019s inductive biases were independent of each other\u2019s, then it would be impossible to predict how other generalize their concepts, and therefore to map meaning to a shared language. In order to prevent this problem, we rely on the fact that all people have similar inductive biases to enable us to infer that the concepts that others associate with words are likely to be similar to ours given the data we observe. This helps to weaken what would otherwise be the death grip of Quine\u2019s indeterminacy of translation. A metric space provides the basis for a bias, but the bias consists of both a metric and a function. This function is the shape of the bias or the generalization structure of the bias. The body provides a metric space in terms of sensory perception and motor actions and the perceived distances and similarities between various forms of each. The mind provides computational biases and therefore a shape/generalization structure. Since we have similar bodies and similar minds, we can guarantee that we have similar biases. This enables us to co-generalize and therefore to communicate. There are some meanings that are more difficult to express than others using a given language This difficulty is modulated by the precision or sensitivity of the meaning (how close it is to other meanings), the connections between this meaning and other meanings, the distance from ground, and the degree of exchangeability of the meaning There are other meanings that are impossible to get evidence for and must be trusted or guessed based on non-communicative means These are the meanings that are fully exchangeable These meanings cannot be communicated in a verifiable way, meaning that there is no way for another agent to verify whether the meanings are one way or another using communication  The meanings that are fully exchangeable includes the set of subjective phenomena The \u201cexplanatory gap\u201d in philosophy of mind emerges in this way from the epistemic features of communication. Subjective beings cannot verifiably communicate their subjective experiences because they exchangeable with respect to the set of communicable utterances about them. They are neither observable nor ground-able in the observable and therefore they are communicatively exchangeable A full theory of communication and causality should be able to predict, given a language, the difficulty of verifying the meanings of different words to a given degree as well as\u2014independent of language, which meanings are not communicable Such a theory would be built as a Bayesian probably approximately correct model of learning

V Adena Schackner Psych Job Talk: The Development of social reasoning: the hidden social meaning of others actions and objects   We live in a near constant stream of social information. In faces, voices, actions, inanimate objects owned, designed, and chosen by people.  Her questions: How do people pull social meaning out of social stimuli? How do we use this meaning to navigate the social world? \u201cI am mainly interested in our intuitive social reasoning.\u201d  How do we infer the contents of others\u2019 minds? They are not out there for us to see\u2026  Actions and objects are produced intentionally. Therefore they contain information about social reasoning.  Intentional actions without simple mechanical goals. Such as dance and gesture. And objects such as decoration, art, and music  Structure of the obhjects she is interested is much less constrained by their function.  \u201cHow do we understand arbitrary actions? In terms of mental states: movement-based goals.\u201d Why care about arbitrary artifacts? Actions and artifacts: suspicious coincedences.  \u201cgoals are explanations for actions.\u201d  She claims that we assume that people move efficiently towards their goals. And that we use this implicit rule for inference about other\u2019s goals based on their actions. This sounds like Grice for actions.  She asks, \u201chow do we use efficiency to reason about actions like dance?\u201d  Csibra 2003, Kiraly,   She claims that movements can be seen as goals in themselves. Instead, I would argue that the goal in dance is not the movement, but to approximate a schema or something of this type.  Her prediction: when actions are clearly intentional, but inefficient path to any object or location, we infer the best explanation.  Schachner & Carey 2013; Cognition  Action perceptions are used as data for an inference to the best explanation  To explain AND predict  Her future direction: She thinks that this serves as the foundation of abstract action concepts.  About arbitrary actions and social meaning: Tajfel 1971; Dunham, Baron, Carey, 2011  Imitating arbitrary actions is a sign of social affiliation. Social affiliation is expected to give rise to imitation of arbitrary actions moreso than non-arbitrary actions (probably because of an explaining-away/scalar implicature line of reasoning.)  Do infants only expect social group members to imitate arbitrary actions?  Objects with the same shape: If shape is functional, possibly independently came up with If shape is arbitrary, much less likely that is was independently came up with Arbitrary features tell us about social group and cultural origin. They are therefore very meaningful stimuli.  Archeology as \u201cWhat can this object tell me about the people who made it?\u201d  \u201cAdults are good intuitive archeologists.\u201d  Objects can be used as social signals in adulthood. Ex: the things that people put on their office door, or the things that people put around their homes.  This is also potentially important in childhood. It can be used as inference of potential topics for conversation.  Do preschoolers ue objects to infer shared interests? (Schachner & Kelemen in prep) Do children use shared interests to make an extra inductive leap? i.e. are people with shared interests likely to be friends? Yes, they do, very well. They also do not overgeneralize. However, they do not make this extra leap to infer whether they are best friends. But preschool students might not think that shared interests are relevant to choosing friends.  Do early deficits in object-based social reasoning contribute to difficulties in social interaction in ASD?    If you observe an action, you hypothesize a goal that explains this action. This is because of the idea that actions are efficiently produced with respect to a goal. This should also apply to language.  Degree of arbitrariness for her captures the amount of options that are equivalent for achieving the physical direct goal. But not for the social goal. Arbitrariness actually reflects our distinction between types of goals. Without this physical vs. social typology of goals, this notion disappears. However, this is interesting because it shows that there actually is this general principle for goal inference from action observation. Arbitrariness is therefore with respect to a goal hypothesis.   Perhaps the distinction between physical goals and social goals is the fact that a social goal is defined with respect to a group, but a physical goal is defined with respect to a   How do we identify unintentional actions? How do we differentiate between inefficient and intentional actions, and unintentional actions? I think that this is due to contingencies and inference on contingencies and goals. I.e. fried with turrets sometimes breaks into dance. How do we know if this is intentional?   What are the constraints on actions and how do these constraints affect how we infer contingency relationships and generalize off of these?

V \u201cThe fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.\u201d  -Claude Shannon The Mathematical Theory of Communication   This is problematic for a study of human communication for a few reasons The fundamental problem of communication is NOT that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point The semantics are not irrelevant to the transmission and reconstructing of a message There is no explicit set of possible messages

V Successful coordination is due to a combination of possibilities, not a single one.   Whether I will get my package today is different from whether I will get my package because the postman received my note and different from whether the postman received my note.  Therefore, inference about whether I will receive my package is different from inference about whether the postman received my note.   This is a Kantian distinction between reason and result.    When coordinating, you are trying, not to achieve an intermediate mental change, but an end result (though the end result, in some cases, might be a mental change. This distinction can be illustrated quite clearly in the postman scenario).  Because of this, many causal pathways can often become indistinguishable.     There is a goal, which is an equivalence class of states.  There are intermediate goals, which are metaphorical paths along which the goal can be achieved.  At each intermediate state, there is a set of probabilities of state transitions.  Each state has a degree of closeness to the goal, which is equivalent to the probabilistic distance between the goal and the state in terms of state transitions.  State transitions, however, are not independent of each other, but are due to a number of higher-order hypotheses. In some cases (the ones we consider), these hypotheses correspond to the goal of the coordination partner.   Coordination is the act of achieving a goal through interaction.  When attempting to coordinate, we often attempt to infer the probability of successful coordination.  This probability of successful coordination is equivalent to the sum of the probabilities of the state-transition paths that lead to successful coordination.  The probabilities of these paths are determined, in part by their prior probabilities, which come from a variety of background knowledge about the world and about the particular environment, context, and coordination partner.  They are also determined by observations on the actions that the coordination partner takes, since actions are assumed to be efficient progress towards a goal, and therefore are reflective of such.  By using the actions of the coordination partner to infer the probabilities of their goals, we can also infer their probability of successful coordination.  Importantly, we care only about the end result, and not about the path and the partner\u2019s reasons or goals, therefore, we sum over all partner goals consistent with our goals.  Because of this, we can define a coordination opportunity as occurring when the equivalence class defining our goals intersects with the equivalence class defining the goals of another agent.   If both agents are able to achieve their goals, then coordination was successful.     If the actions are the other agent\u2019s, then you make inferences about his goal. If they are yours, then he makes inferences about your goal. If the goals have an intersection, this intersection might be observed and tended towards by each agent, yielding coordination. If the goals are contradictory, then both agents will try to maximize their own goals. Cooperation vs. antagonism emerges automatically from the goal structures of the agents.   The optimality and goal structures are captured quite well by game theory, which defines normative behavior given perfect knowledge. However, the games are always partially hidden, and therefore there is a large component of the game that is often thought of as inferring the goals of the other player or the thoughts of the other player.  We aim to provide a theory that plugs into game theory in this location, but that does not explicitly consider goal inference as much as inference about final behavior. This final behavior, though it may come from inference on goals, is the more important quality, since the goal is to reach your own goal, independently of the mental states and goals of the other agents.

V Such a theory of coordination predicts, independent of its axioms:  That coordination will often occur when there is misalignment conceptually, and where the alignment is simply enough to successfully achieve the coordination task That in many cases this misalignment will not be detected, and that this is not a hindrance. We should be able to show this experimentally. That there exist some cases where alignment is more easily detectable than in others It would be good to derive which cases these are within the formal framework, find their corresponding cases in empirical phenomena, and show that they have the predicted properties That there exist some cases where alignment is entirely undetectable These cases are those that are often of most interest to philosophy of mind. They include the phenomenological cases. If we can provide proof (from within the system) that these cases are undetectable and that their indetectability is simply due to the structure of the systems and not to a metaphysical property, then we can push into the real of philosophy of mind. Such predictions will help to justify the theoretical framework and associated theories.

V The conceptual alignment problem is not described effectively in the game theoretic framework. This is because of the representation properties of game theoretic matrices. A conceptually misaligned signaling system, represented game theoretically, is indistinguishable from a perfectly conceptually aligned one. This is because there exists no mechanisms in game theory to coordinate the signal meanings between agents. In a one-shot signaling game, the pay-offs are given and dependent only upon the state of affairs, not the signals. They can be made dependent on the signals by instituting a relation between states of affairs and signals, but this relation is not observable by the  The only mechanism is a meta game theoretic one and involves observation of effects or pay-offs and learning of pay-off structure for future rounds. This is the interesting component of coordination and communication and it is this that we will investigate.   Or maybe not??

V Things I am interested in covering in future tutorials: When I see something, what is the relation between that thing and my perception of it? (from the 2003 paper)? Why, according to Putnam, can\u2019t brains in the vat think that they are brains in the vat? What kind of coherence is needed for the coherence theory of knowledge? How do proper names refer? What is the nature of possible worlds? Discuss some problems of avoiding the ontological commitment to universals. Are there good reasons to assume that propositions, conceived as language-independent objects, exist? Do properties and propositions exist ante rem or in rebus? Did McTaggart show that time is not real? Does compatibilism solve the problem of free will?   Ask Volker if we can do something less along the lines of conceptual analysis.  Tell Volker that I am going to be away on March 4th  Consider working on criticisms of contextualism

V Thom Scott-Phillips The Evolution of Human Communication and Language  Not much focus on language origins with respect to pragmatics  Pinker and Bloom focus on compositionality and high bandwidth with respect to language origins  Code model communication: Conduit metaphor and information theory  Natural codes are pairs of associations that are set up symmetrically A natural code is a code that makes communication possible (for the code model)  The linguistic code is not a natural code The linguistic code does not make communication possible Grice and Wittgenstein  Not just that there is ambiguity in language, but that the code does not of work.  Relevance Ostensive-inferential communication is the expression and recognition of intentions There are communicative and informative intentions  Mechanisms of metapsychology vs. mechanisms of association There should also be mechanisms of generalization  He thinks communication is made possible by metapsychology and expressive my association  Our terminology should reflect this: natural codes vs. conventional codes  The social cognitive mechanisms that make ostensive communication possible The creation and cultural evolution of conventional codes  Do great apes communicate with ostention and inference??  Expression is production Recognition is comprehension  He makes an interesting distinction between informative intentions and communicative intentions.  Does great ape communication use natural codes? It is uncontraversally accepted to be intentional Ontogenetic ritualization is the process of how interaction between people over time tends to model the forms of the interactions.   We don\u2019t have AI that communicates with humans as humans Is this due to the fact that AI is done as a code-type model, and therefore that it is not capturing the qualitative nature of ostensive inferential communication? Or is this due to the fact that we don\u2019t have a good enough code model? Lera wants to know: how can we distinguish between these empirically? Would it be possible to prove via a mind-switching experiment that effective communicative practices could not be accomplished by a code model of communication? Could we used the fixed nature of a code model and the flexible and inferential notion of communication to prove that a code model account is impossible?

V We do not have an account of coordination and communication that explains why we have such robust communication despite the fact that we have uncertainty about the ways that others understand words, sentences, concepts, grammar, things about the world, etc. We do this through a process of interaction and causal inference. It is this process that I wish to formalize, first for coordination, and then for communication.  First we demonstrate and motivate.  Then we introduce the formal theory.  Then we apply the formal theory to examples.
